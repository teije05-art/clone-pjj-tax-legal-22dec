Pursuant to the terms of the Engagement Letter dated 4 May 2022, we set out in this memo our comments on the Vietnamese tax implications arising for the expatriate – Mr. N, under different employment/assignment arrangements as set out below.

Background and our understanding of your requirements

Based on the information provided, we understand - Mr. N’s (“you”, “the expatriate” or “the individual”) circumstances to be as follows:

You hold German citizenship  

You have been employed by C Pte Ltd (“C Singapore”) from 1 April 2022. You will become Managing Director (“MD”) of C Ltd (“C Vietnam”) starting from 1 June 2022. The draft employment contracts provided are two separate contracts with the two entities.  It is intended that your total income will be split 60%:40% from C Singapore and C Vietnam, respectively. However, the split of income does not represent the split of time relating to the two roles. We understand that most of the expatriate’s time will be as the MD of C Vietnam.

Under the current Singapore arrangement, you bear the tax costs in Singapore (i.e. receiving income gross of tax). The draft documents provided indicate that you will also receive income gross of Vietnam tax.

To fully comply with the Personal Income Tax (PIT) regulations in Vietnam, the Company requests KPMG to address the following matters:

Review of the individual’s two employment contracts (as provided) and comment on the tax and social security obligations in Vietnam arising from the current contracts.

Explore the possibility of implementing a secondment arrangement to be based in Vietnam, or a Dual Employment (“DE”) arrangement, advising if these arrangements are legally recognised in Vietnam and whether it helps to meet the aim of the individual to not pay taxes in Vietnam on his full income. 

Employer and employee tax and social security obligations under secondment and DE arrangements.

Comment on the double taxation issues (if applicable) and methods to alleviate double taxation.

Provide recommendation on the employment arrangement for tax optimization purposes from a Vietnam tax perspective. 

Legal basis and limitations

Our advice presented below is based on the information and documents provided by the Company and the relevant regulations which are currently in force in Vietnam as of the date of this advice. Please refer to Appendix 1 and 2 for Vietnam PIT implication and legal basis.
Our comments are from a Vietnamese PIT perspective only. Any other matters such as Corporate Income Tax, Foreign Contractor Tax, Labour regulation, Immigration matters in relation to the assignment should be considered and assessed separately as required. We will be pleased to assist on those matters separately if so instructed.

Our comments are based on employment income paid by the mentioned Companies (i.e. C Singapore and C Vietnam). We have not considered any income earned from other sources, if any, including non-employment income. 

If you have non-employment income such as rental income, dividends, capital gains, sale of a property, etc. and need our assistance in advice on tax implications during your assignment to Vietnam, please contact us to discuss how we may assist.

Executive summary

Based on information provided, it is likely that you will stay in Vietnam for more than 182 days in 12 months from the first date of your arrival to Vietnam or in a calendar tax year. Therefore, you will be treated as a Vietnam tax resident and subject to tax on your worldwide income at the progressive tax rates from 5% to 35% regardless of your employment arrangement.  According to the income level stated in current contract, the majority of your income will be subject to tax at 35%.

In order to minimize the tax implications due to mobility, we have considered three possible arrangements:

Arrangement 1: Dual employment contracts (equivalent to the current draft proposed arrangement)
Arrangement 2: Secondment under international assignment
Arrangement 3: Vietnam local contract.

Each arrangement has pros and cons and the detailed analysis on PIT and SHI implications as well as double taxation issues are set out below. 

We consider that Arrangement 2, with the application of a tax equalization policy, would be the best option in terms of Vietnam PIT & SHI optimization. This arrangement also ensures that the tax burden in the host country should not be a decisive factor or cause for concern for the expatriate. Please note that Arrangement 2 would be subject to consideration of the Work permit application and approval of Vietnam Labor authority. 

Arrangement 3, which involves a review of the individual's income package in consideration of the appropriate tax rate and SHI contribution in Vietnam, is an alternative practical strategy to explore if Arrangement 2 is not feasible.
	We consider that arrangement 1 DE, as currently structured, could result in double taxation in both Singapore and Vietnam as the Singapore contract will be subject to tax in Singapore but it will be difficult to justify this income as non Vietnam source as the majority of the time the expatriate will be in Vietnam acting as the MD of C Vietnam and therefore a FTC is unlikely to be accepted.  We understand that arrangement 2 and 3 should not be subject to tax in Singapore as advised by KPMG Singapore but this should be confirmed directly with them.

Our detailed comments 

We summarise the PIT, Social & Health Insurance (SHI) and other related matters, including double taxation arising from your employment arrangement as below for the Company and your consideration.

Based on the information provided, we have proposed three possible arrangements and set out the applicable PIT and SHI implication.  

Arrangement 1: Dual employment - You will sign separate employment contracts with C Singapore and C Vietnam. Each contract will set out the duties and income for each entity separately. Your income will be paid separately.

Arrangement  2: Secondment – You will be assigned from C Singapore to work on long term assignment at C Vietnam. In this instance, there will be one assignment letter from C Singapore which will state explicitly that you will be allocated from C Singapore to C Vietnam. You will be based in Vietnam and visit Singapore for business trips (if required). All your income will be paid from C Singapore.

Arrangement  3: Local contract – You will sign a local contract with C Vietnam and will visit Singapore as part of a business trip; there will be no employment contract signed with C Singapore. Your whole income will be paid to you by C Vietnam.








Our recommendation and comments on employment contract/ arrangement:

Based on the above analysis and the individual's objective is not to be impacted by increased taxation as a result of mobilization, we have provided our comments for each of the arrangement for the purpose of tax optimization. 

Arrangement 1: Dual employment contracts

You will sign separate contracts and receive separate income from C Singapore and C Vietnam. From Vietnam legal perspective, this is possible.  However, on the assumption the expatriate will be tax resident, it is only effective to avoid double taxation if the contracts and income reflect the roles and responsibilities in both jurisdictions.  We understand that the expatriate will spend most of their time working as the MD of C Vietnam.  

As stated above a FTC may be available for Singapore tax paid on non Vietnam source income.  For the assessment of a FTC in Vietnam, it is very important to consider the interpretation of the local tax authority on what constitutes “foreign-source income”. There is no clear guidance under the current tax regulations on the definition of Vietnamese sourced income and foreign sourced income. However, it is generally understood that the income relating to Vietnam work performance is considered as Vietnamese sourced income and vice versa. 

As mentioned in background, we understand that 60% of your income will be borne by C Singapore and the rest by C Vietnam. The two contracts should separately and clearly define the roles and the related income. However, the tax authority are likely to challenge this allocation if you are present in Vietnam most of the time and the income from C Vietnam does not reflect that of an MD position versus your role in Singapore.

To claim the FTC, supporting documents on the income and taxes paid overseas must be available including but not limited to:

-	Oversea tax return showing the income subject to tax in both jurisdictions;

-	The original tax payment certificate issued by the overseas tax authority. Where the overseas tax authority does not have a mechanism to issue such tax payment certificate, a copy of confirmation on the actual overseas tax withheld issued by the overseas Employer can be used; OR

-	A copy of the tax payment voucher/bank transfer to settle the overseas tax paid to the overseas tax authority.

Apart from the above-mentioned documents, the Vietnamese tax authority can request further supporting documents proving that 60% of your time is to perform non-Vietnam related work such as working report and timesheet to justify the allocation of Singapore and Vietnam sourced income, copy of full page of your passport to assess your physical days staying in Vietnam. Failure to prove the nature of foreign sourced income will result in the FTC being rejected by the Vietnam tax authorities.  

A DE is more effective in Vietnam for an individual who is non resident. In this case the income from C Vietnam would be taxed at 20% and it would be likely that the income from C Singapore would be seen as not Vietnam sourced and therefore not subject to tax in Vietnam.


Arrangement 2: Secondment:

Under the secondment arrangement, you will be subject to tax on your worldwide income at the graduated rates up to 35% as set out above.

It is common practice that, in order to promote a mobility assignment, a Company will ensure that the tax regime of the host country is not a factor that is part of the consideration for the employee. Therefore, it is recommended that the assignment arrangement will incorporate a clause that the employer will protect the employee from any tax disadvantages due to the different tax rates between home and host country. In other words, the expatriate will not have to pay tax in excess of the tax amount that would have to be paid in your home country. As such the Company can consider applying a Tax Equalisation policy, in which hypothetical tax based on Singapore tax rate and regulation will be deducted on a monthly basis from your income. In this case, the expatriate will only be responsible for the equivalent of the tax that would be paid in Singapore, the Vietnam tax in excess of the Singapore tax will be borne by the Company.

Hypothetical tax deducted from income under a tax equalisation arrangement is also treated as a deduction for PIT purposes in Vietnam. To support the hypothetical tax deduction, under the Vietnam rules, the Company needs to provide the following supporting documents, hence it is necessary for these to be kept on file:

Labour contract/assignment letter confirming that a hypothetical tax deduction will be applied on stay-at-home income whilst on assignment
Payment vouchers or pay slips showing the income settlement/payment to the individual, including any balance payment sheet on hypothetical tax
Please also make sure the tax equalisation policy is arranged properly.

From an immigration perspective, since C Singapore and C Vietnam do not have a direct relationship as parent and subsidiary or affiliate, it is noted that under this type of employment arrangement it may be difficult to obtain a work permit in Vietnam in the form of international secondee. 

In order to obtain a work permit under this arrangement, the mandatory document is that the assignment letter should be issued by the Head Office (i.e. parent company of the two C Singapore and C Vietnam). If the Company wish to follow this option and need further assistance advise, we can coordinate with our immigration team if so instructed.

Arrangement 3: Local contract

You will sign a local contract with C Vietnam only, no employment contract is signed in this case with C Singapore. 

In practice this arrangement is likely to be the simplest from both a tax and immigration perspective although it does result in additional SHI. 

As above, if the Company wishes to assist you in ensuring that you pay no more than the Singapore tax rate, the Company may do a cost projection by calculating your income with the Vietnam tax rate and SHI to arrive at the new income for the local contract where your net take home (after tax and SHI) remains the same.

In conclusion, Arrangement 2 may be the most optimal in terms of tax and SHI optimization.  However, the possibility of getting a WP under this arrangement should be investigated.  If the expatriate cannot get a Work permit as a secondee, Arrangement 3 should be considered. 


If you and the Company still prefer the application of DE arrangement 1, we would be happy to discuss in detail what should be included in order to enhance as much as possible the ability to get a FTC for any Singapore source income and to ensure there is no duplication of benefits.   


Interpretation of Laws and Future Changes in Laws

We have been requested to advise on the Vietnamese tax and regulatory consequences associated with the above arrangements only. Our advice therefore focuses on current laws and regulations within the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and will not consider issues belonging to other tax jurisdictions.

The advice has been prepared based on the documents and information supplied by you and the current laws and regulations, which are issued by the competent authorities of Vietnam, as at the date of the advice.  Where regulations are quoted in English in this advice, the quotation may be from a KPMG unofficial translation of the source document and not an official translation. You will appreciate that the tax law is frequently changing, both prospectively and retrospectively. A number of key tax reform measures have been implemented, a number of other key reforms have been deferred and the status of some key reforms remains unclear at this stage. We are, of course, unable to give any guarantee that our interpretation will ultimately be sustained in the event of challenge by the Vietnamese tax authorities.

Unless special arrangements are made, our advice provided will not be updated to take account of subsequent changes to the tax legislation, case law, rulings and determinations issued by the Vietnamese tax governing bodies or other practices of taxation authorities. It is your responsibility to seek further advice or updates, if you are to rely on our advice at a later date.

We hope the above is clear. Please contact our office if you have any questions regarding this.

Yours sincerely

APPENDIX 1
BASIS VIETNAM PIT IMPLICATIONS

Determine tax residency status

The taxation of an individual in Vietnam depends solely on his residency status. There are two types of taxpayers in Vietnam: tax resident and tax non-resident.

Tax resident

Individuals are considered as tax residents of Vietnam if they meet one of the following conditions:

They reside in Vietnam for 183 days or more in a calendar year or 12 consecutive months from their first date of arrival (the arrival and departure days together count as one day); or

Have a permanent residential place in Vietnam, in particular:

The place which has been registered and recorded on the permanent residence card or temporary residence card issued by a competent authority; or

Having a leased house or the likes i.e. hotels, guest houses in Vietnam where the lease term totals 183 days or more in the tax year.

And in both the above cases being unable to prove that they are tax resident of another country

Tax residents of Vietnam are taxed on worldwide income, including employment income and non-employment income (including investment and passive income, capital assignment, securities transfer, real property transfers, winning or prizes, royalties, franchises, inheritances and gifts, etc.).

Tax non-resident

Individuals who do not meet the above conditions are considered as tax non - resident of Vietnam.

Non-tax residents are taxed on Vietnam-sourced income only. For employment income, Vietnam-sourced income is income earned or received in relation to the performance of employment services of that foreign individual in Vietnam, regardless of origin or country where the remuneration is paid. A non-tax resident does not have any obligation to declare non-employment income unless it arises from Vietnam.

The following chart demonstrates the determination of tax residency status in details. Please refer to the Appendix 2.1 for the detailed legal basis in words.
Tax rate

Employment income

Tax resident

Unified progressive tax rates applicable to tax resident’s employment income are as follows:


Tax non-resident

Flat tax rate of 20% shall be applicable to employment taxable income of non- resident taxpayers.

Non-employment income

Flat rates applicable to other incomes for tax residents and non-residents are as follows:


Timeline for PIT declaration

Employment income

PIT declaration for expatriate employees include (i) provisional declarations on a monthly or quarterly basis for tax residents and non-residents, and (ii) finalisation declaration at the year-end or upon termination of their assignment in Vietnam for tax residents.

Where an expatriate only receives employment income from the Company, his/her PIT will be declared under the Company’s tax code for monthly and year-end finalization declarations.

Where an expatriate receives employment income from both the Company in Vietnam and his/her overseas employer, PIT declarations should be carried out as follows:

For income received from the Company in Vietnam, the Company shall withhold and declare PIT under the Company’s monthly/quarterly PIT declaration before making payment to the expatriate.

For income received from the overseas employer (e.g. parent company), the expatriate shall declare directly with the tax authorities on a quarterly basis under individual’s tax code. At the year end, the expatriate shall finalise his/her PIT directly with the tax authorities.

Expatriate employees who are tax residents and no longer work in Vietnam shall complete tax finalisation with tax authorities within 45 days from the date they depart from Vietnam directly with the tax authorities.

The following table sets out the deadline for PIT declaration


Note (*): The individuals are not required to make annual PIT finalisation declaration if the payable tax amount is smaller than the withheld or temporarily paid tax amounts in the year and they do not request tax refund or clearing of the overpaid tax amount against the payable tax amount of the subsequent periods.

Non-employment income


Taxable income

Under the PIT regulations, the scope of taxable income includes the following categories:

Income from employment (in any forms, cash or in kind); and

Other (non-employment) income such as business income, investment income, capital gains, royalty, income from franchising, and income from inheritances, gifts, etc.

The detailed information (i.e. types of income, tax treatment) is shown in the Appendix 2.1 and 2.2.

Tax deduction

Vietnam resident taxpayers may be entitled to the following tax deductions for PIT calculation in Vietnam:


Penalty and interest

According to the Law on Tax Management and its implementing guidelines (Decree 125), any non-compliance with the submission of the PIT return and late payment will lead to an administrative penalty and interest, as follows:

Administrative penalty:
For organisation:
Late filing up to 90 days: a penalty of up to VND15 million;
Late filing more than 90 days: a penalty of up to VND25million. 
For individual: Half of the above noted penalty shall be applied for individual tax declaration.

Late payment of tax: Interest charge on outstanding tax amount at 0.03% per day.

Late payment of penalty: Interest charge on outstanding penalty at 0.05% per day.

Under-declaration of tax: At 20% of the tax shortfall.

Tax evasion: Up to three times of the outstanding tax liability. Tax evasion is defined to include the submission of tax returns more than 90 days after the deadline.
