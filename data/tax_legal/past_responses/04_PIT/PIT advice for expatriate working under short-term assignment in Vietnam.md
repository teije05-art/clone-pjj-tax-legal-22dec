Pursuant to the terms of the Engagement Letter dated 5 July 2021, we set out in this memo our comments on the Vietnamese tax implications arising from the expatriate working under short-term assignment in Vietnam.

Background and our understanding of your requirements

Based on the information provided, we understand that Mr. H’s (“the expatriate” or “the individual”) case is as follows:

Mr. H has Vietnam nationality and also holds a green card in US.

He was assigned to work for the W, Inc., Representative office in Viet Nam (W-Viet Nam) under a one-year assignment for the period from May 2021 to April 2022. He will work 85% of his time for the Host Office (Viet Nam) and 15% of his time for Home Office (US).

Due to visa issues, he cannot stay and work in Vietnam for more than 6 months in a calendar year. Hence, the number of his physical days in Vietnam during this one-year period is expected to be less than 183 days.

His remuneration whist working in Vietnam includes the following:


To fully comply with the Personal Income Tax (PIT) regulations in Vietnam, the Company requests KPMG to address the following matters:

Provide comments on Personal Income Tax (PIT) obligations of the authorized individual from a Vietnamese tax perspective; 
Comment on the methods to mitigate the cost of double taxation between Vietnam and the home country (if any); 
Comment on the method of income allocation between VN source income and oversea sourced income for case of tax non-resident. 

Limitations

Our comments are from a Vietnamese PIT perspective only. Any other matters such as Corporate Income Tax, Foreign Contractor Tax, Permanent Establishment risk in relation to a service agreement between a Vietnamese entity and a foreign entity should be considered and assessed separately as required.

Our comments are based on employment income paid by the mentioned Companies (i.e. W-Viet am and W-US only). We have not considered any income earned from other sources, if any, including non-employment income. 

If he has non-employment income such as rental income, dividends, capital gains, sale of a property, etc. and needs our assistance in advice on tax implications during his assignment to Vietnam, please contact us to discuss how we may assist.

We have not been requested to review the PIT calculation to conclude if it is calculated in line with the Vietnamese PIT regulations.

Our analysis of the individual’s Vietnam tax position taken

PIT implications of the authorized individual from a Vietnamese tax perspective

We understand that Mr. H expects to stay in Vietnam for less than 183 days in the calendar year 2021 and 2022. However, as he still retains Vietnamese nationality and a household registration in Vietnam, to qualify as a Vietnam tax non-resident, a Tax Residency Certificate issued by US authority (“US TRC”) for the tax year 2021-2022 is required to prove that he is a tax resident of another country.

In this regard, we would like to summarise the two possible scenarios of residency status and PIT obligations that will arise for him as follow:

Scenario 1: US TRC for the tax year 2021-2022 can be obtained

He will be considered as a tax non-resident in Vietnam in the tax year 2021 and 2022.

As a tax non-resident, he is required to declare his Vietnam sourced employment income at the flat tax rate of 20% (shown in Section 4.2 below) on a quarterly basis. A tax non-resident is not required to declare annual tax filing. At the year-end and when he departs from Vietnam, he is also NOT required to file his Vietnam termination finalisation.

As set out in the hosting agreement he will work 85% of his time for the Host Office and 15% of his time for Home Office. Therefore, only the income paid for 85% of his time working for Host office is considered as Vietnam sourced income and subject to tax in Vietnam.

Personal relief and dependent relief are not be allowed to be deducted for calculation of the taxable income of a non-resident. 

A non-tax resident does not have any obligation to declare non-employment income unless it arises from Vietnam.

Scenario 2: US TRC for the tax year 2021-2022 is NOT available

He will be considered as a tax resident in Vietnam in the tax year 2021 and 2022.

As a tax resident, he will be subject to the Vietnamese progressive tax rates ranging from 5% to 35% on his worldwide employment income regardless of where such income is paid. He will be required to file quarterly returns and tax finalisation return for that period. Please refer to the detailed tax rates for both employment income and non-employment income for a tax resident in Section 4.2 below.

He is entitled to personal relief of VND11,000,000 per month and dependent relief of VND4,400,000 for each dependent per month. The personal relief is automatically applied while the dependent relief is only available after successfully registration of the dependent. The detailed requirement and documents for dependent registration is included in Appendix 2.3. 

As set out in the hosting agreement, it is noted that he will work 85% of his time for Host Office and 15% of his time for Home Office. Hence, the income paid for 15% of his time working for Home office can be considered as foreign sourced income and a foreign tax credit can be applied for the corresponding tax amount paid in the US. Please refer to the detailed analysis of foreign tax credit application and its conditions in Section 3.2 below.

In addition to employment income, being a Vietnam tax resident, he is also required to declare for any non-employment income. The tax rate and timeline for declaration for each type of non-employment income is included in Section 4.2 and 4.3.

Other PIT issues for consideration:

Besides income directly paid by W-US, any expenses (such as incidental expenses, transportation) directly paid by W-VN may be viewed as non-monetary benefits or benefits in-kind and should be subject to PIT in Vietnam. This has been confirmed in many Official Letters (OL) such as OL 8133/CT-TTHT dated 23 August 2017. Where such expenses are subject to PIT, W-VN is required to withhold PIT at source and declare via W-VN’s tax return for these business expenses paid for the expatriate. Such income is required to be combined with his income directly paid by W-US under his PIT finalisation at the tax year-end in case of scenario 2. 

PIT exemption is available for foreigners who directly participate in programs and projects funded by foreign non-governmental aid in Vietnam, the following conditions need to be met:

The individuals have foreign nationality; and

There is a contract signed between the expatriate and foreign NGOs/ the project governing body/ the owner of foreign non-governmental aid in Vietnam for direct implementation of activities of the programs and projects on foreign non-governmental aid under the program and project document approved by competent agencies and terms of reference (TOR) documents attached to this contract.

In this case, as Mr. H has a US green card but not US nationality, the PIT exemption cannot be applied for a Vietnamese citizen. 

In addition, as mentioned above that W-Viet Nam will contribute US$30,000, approximately 15% of the total position cost, through a separate Grant Agreement. If W-US bills service fees to W-Viet Nam, Vietnamese Foreign Contactor Tax will be imposed. Please let us know if you need our detailed advice on this matter.

Please kindly note that the above analysis is based on the current regulations.

The possibility of mitigating the cost of double taxation between Vietnam and the home country

Technically, Vietnamese PIT of the expatriate may be exempt under Double Tax Agreement (“DTA”) between Vietnam and home country where the DTA conditions are met. However, even though the DTA between Vietnam and the US was countersigned in 2015, the agreement has not entered into force due to the incompletion of approval procedures in the US. Hence, consideration of the DTA cannot be applied in this case.

Pursuant to the Vietnam domestic law, for Vietnam tax resident individuals, where income is taxed twice in both Vietnam and other jurisdictions and the income qualifies as foreign sourced income, then tax paid in the overseas jurisdiction can be creditable in Vietnam provided that proper supporting documents are available for submission together with annual PIT dossiers. In this particular case, the expatriate can explore the option to claim a credit for US tax paid on his foreign sourced income to eliminate double taxation. For assessment of a FTC in Vietnam, it is very important to consider the interpretation of the local tax authority on what constitutes “foreign-source income”. There is no clear guidance under the current tax regulations on the definition of Vietnamese sourced income and foreign sourced income. However, it is generally understood that the income relating to Vietnam work performance can be considered as Vietnamese sourced income and vice versa. 

As mentioned in section 3.1 above, the income paid for his time working for the Home office (15%) can be considered as foreign sourced income and foreign tax credit can be applied for the corresponding tax amount paid in the US on such income. The credited amount cannot exceed the tax payable calculated according to Vietnam regulations on total worldwide income. The Vietnam tax on the foreign source income is determined by the ratio between the amount of income generated overseas and total worldwide income subjecting to Vietnam tax.

To claim the FTC, supporting documents on the income and taxes paid overseas must be available including but not limited to:

-	Oversea tax return showing the income subject to tax in both jurisdictions;

-	The original tax payment certificate issued by the overseas tax authority. Where the overseas tax authority does not have a mechanism to issue such tax payment certificate, a copy of confirmation on the actual overseas tax withheld issued by the overseas Employer can be used; OR

-	A copy of the tax payment voucher/bank transfer to settle the overseas tax paid to the overseas tax authority.

Please note that in reviewing the FTC application, beside the above-mentioned documents, the Vietnamese tax authority can request further supporting documents proving that 15% of his time is to perform non-Vietnam related work. This may include the hosting agreement, assignment letter which clearly noted this point, working report and timesheet to justify the allocation of US and Vietnam sourced income. Please note that failure to prove the nature of foreign sourced income, the FTC could be rejected by Vietnam tax authorities.  

Legal basis:

Our advice is formed on the legal basis shown below.

Determine tax residency status

The taxation of an individual in Vietnam depends solely on his residency status. There are two types of taxpayers in Vietnam: tax resident and tax non-resident.

Tax resident

Individuals are considered as tax residents of Vietnam if they meet one of the following conditions:

They reside in Vietnam for 183 days or more in a calendar year or 12 consecutive months from their first date of arrival (the arrival and departure days together count as one day); or

Have a permanent residential place in Vietnam, in particular:

The place which has been registered and recorded on the permanent residence card or temporary residence card issued by a competent authority; or

Having a leased house or the likes i.e. hotels, guest houses in Vietnam where the lease term totals 183 days or more in the tax year.

And in both the above cases being unable to prove that they are tax resident of another country

Tax residents of Vietnam are taxed on worldwide income, including employment income and non-employment income (including investment and passive income, capital assignment, securities transfer, real property transfers, winning or prizes, royalties, franchises, inheritances and gifts, etc.).

Tax non-resident

Individuals who do not meet the above conditions are considered as tax non - resident of Vietnam.

Non-tax residents are taxed on Vietnam-sourced income only. For employment income, Vietnam-sourced income is income earned or received in relation to the performance of employment services of that foreign individual in Vietnam, regardless of origin or country where the remuneration is paid. A non-tax resident does not have any obligation to declare non-employment income unless it arises from Vietnam.

The following chart demonstrates the determination of tax residency status in details. Please refer to the Appendix 2.1 for the detailed legal basis in words.
Tax rate

Employment income

Tax resident

Unified progressive tax rates applicable to tax resident’s employment income are as follows:


Tax non-resident

Flat tax rate of 20% shall be applicable to employment taxable income of non- resident taxpayers.

Non-employment income

Flat rates applicable to other incomes for tax residents and non-residents are as follows:


Timeline for PIT declaration

Employment income

PIT declaration for expatriate employees include (i) provisional declarations on a monthly or quarterly basis for tax residents and non-residents, and (ii) finalisation declaration at the year-end or upon termination of their assignment in Vietnam for tax residents.

Where an expatriate only receives employment income from the Company, his/her PIT will be declared under the Company’s tax code for monthly and year-end finalization declarations.

Where an expatriate receives employment income from both the Company in Vietnam and his/her overseas employer, PIT declarations should be carried out as follows:

For income received from the Company in Vietnam, the Company shall withhold and declare PIT under the Company’s monthly/quarterly PIT declaration before making payment to the expatriate.

For income received from the overseas employer (e.g. parent company), the expatriate shall declare directly with the tax authorities on a quarterly basis under individual’s tax code. At the year end, the expatriate shall finalise his/her PIT directly with the tax authorities.

Expatriate employees who are tax residents and no longer work in Vietnam shall complete tax finalisation with tax authorities within 45 days from the date they depart from Vietnam directly with the tax authorities.

The following table sets out the deadline for PIT declaration


Note (*): The individuals are not required to make annual PIT finalisation declaration if the payable tax amount is smaller than the withheld or temporarily paid tax amounts in the year and they do not request tax refund or clearing of the overpaid tax amount against the payable tax amount of the subsequent periods.

Non-employment income


Taxable income

Under the PIT regulations, the scope of taxable income includes the following categories:

Income from employment (in any forms, cash or in kind); and

Other (non-employment) income such as business income, investment income, capital gains, royalty, income from franchising, and income from inheritances, gifts, etc.

The detailed information (i.e. types of income, tax treatment) is shown in the Appendix 2.1 and 2.2.



Tax deduction

Vietnam resident taxpayers may be entitled to the following tax deductions for PIT calculation in Vietnam:


Penalty and interest

According to the Law on Tax Management and its implementing guidelines (Decree 125), any non-compliance with the submission of the PIT return and late payment will lead to an administrative penalty and interest, as follows:

Administrative penalty:
For organisation:
Late filing up to 90 days: a penalty of up to VND15 million;
Late filing more than 90 days: a penalty of up to VND25million. 
For individual: Half of the above noted penalty shall be applied for individual tax declaration.

Late payment of tax: Interest charge on outstanding tax amount at 0.03% per day.

Late payment of penalty: Interest charge on outstanding penalty at 0.05% per day.

Under-declaration of tax: At 20% of the tax shortfall.

Tax evasion: Up to three times of the outstanding tax liability. Tax evasion is defined to include the submission of tax returns more than 90 days after the deadline.

Interpretation of Laws and Future Changes in Laws

We have been requested to advise on the Vietnamese tax and regulatory consequences associated with the above arrangements only. Our advice therefore focuses on current laws and regulations within the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and will not consider issues belonging to other tax jurisdictions.

The advice has been prepared based on the documents and information supplied by you and the current laws and regulations, which are issued by the competent authorities of Vietnam, as at the date of the advice.  Where regulations are quoted in English in this advice, the quotation may be from a KPMG unofficial translation of the source document and not an official translation.  You will appreciate that the tax law is frequently changing, both prospectively and retrospectively.  A number of key tax reform measures have been implemented, a number of other key reforms have been deferred and the status of some key reforms remains unclear at this stage.  We are, of course, unable to give any guarantee that our interpretation will ultimately be sustained in the event of challenge by the Vietnamese tax authorities.

Unless special arrangements are made, our advice provided will not be updated to take account of subsequent changes to the tax legislation, case law, rulings and determinations issued by the Vietnamese tax governing bodies or other practices of taxation authorities.  It is your responsibility to seek further advice or updates, if you are to rely on our advice at a later date.

We hope the above is clear. Please contact our office if you have any questions regarding this.

Yours sincerely
