Dear [Name],

We refer to your email dated … and would like to set out a summary of the Vietnamese tax, immigration, social security insurance and labour implications with respect to secondment of employee to Vietnam.

BACKGROUND OF INFORMATION

Based on the information provided in your email dated …, we understand the following facts:

ABC Company (“ABC” or “the Company”) has seconded employees to Vietnam under the below arrangement:

The employee is assigned to work in Vietnam under the secondment agreement between DEF Company (“DEF”) and XYZ Vietnam Company (“XYZ Vietnam”). The employees assigned to Vietnam can be supported by an employment contract between the expatriate employee and local employer.

The employee will be under the direct supervision of XYZ Vietnam. Under the arrangement and in consideration of the compensation, benefits and other compensation-related amounts paid by DEF to the seconded personnel, XYZ Vietnam agrees and undertakes to reimburse DEF for all such amounts paid by DEF to or on behalf of personnel plus an overhead charge of approximately 5%.

Currently the Company is considering to second an employee who is a dual citizen of Vietnam and France (“the Employee”) to work in Vietnam. The company is hoping to put the employee on a DEF assignment with the home country being France assigned to Vietnam. Under the assignment, the employee will be paid by DEF, a Swiss entity, but be considered a local employee under secondment in Vietnam.

In this regard, we would like to highlight relevant issues and tax implications which the Company should consider under the current regulations including but not limited to:

Immigration
Labour compliance
Corporate Income Tax 
Foreign Contractor Tax
Personal Income Tax 
Compulsory insurance 



LEGAL BASIS AND LIMITATIONS

Our high level summary presented below is based on the information and documents provided by the Company and the relevant regulations which are currently in force in Vietnam as of the date of this report. If the client wants to have a deep analysis for any areas highlighted in this report or for specific facts and circumstances, we can do so under a separate fee.

SUMMARY OF KEY ISSUES RELATING TO SECONDMEND OF EMPLOYEE

Immigration

Under the current Vietnamese regulations, there is no clear guidance on immigration process for an individual who is a dual citizen to enter Vietnam for working purposes. In practice, we have observed that individuals who have dual residency can choose to enter Vietnam using a foreign passport or a Vietnamese passport. Neither approach has been challenged by the immigration authority so far provided that the immigration documents for each choice are properly supported.

If the Employee decides to enter Vietnam using a French passport, the Employee must comply with immigration regulations for a foreigner. Generally, a visa will enable the foreigner to enter and stay in Vietnam. A Temporary Residency Card (TRC) has the same validity as a visa to enable the expatriates to stay legally in Vietnam. However, a TRC can only be obtained when the employees are already in Vietnam and hold a valid Work Permit (WP). The Employee needs to obtain a valid WP based on the assumption that the Employee will stay in Vietnam for more than 29 days per trip and/or more than 3 trips/year.

Depending on the form of the assignment and the supporting documents, different working forms apply for work permit purposes including but not limited to: 


We can review the detail and advise separately the working form for work permit in this case depending on the availability of the supporting document. 

If the Employee decides to use their Vietnamese passport to enter Vietnam, the Employee can enter Vietnam normally like other local Vietnamese. No WP is required for a Vietnamese to work in Vietnam. 

Labour compliance 

In case a work permit is obtained under the working form of labour contract where a local labour contract is set up, labour compliance must follow the Vietnamese Labour Code. As a result there are additional costs which can be incurred due to compliance requirements including but not limited to:

Trade Union fees
Payment of severance allowance upon termination of labour contract
Other termination payment upon termination of a labour contract such as unused annual leave
The working hours and schedule need to be in compliance with the Labour code

One more point to consider is that in accordance with foreign exchange control regulations, only a foreigner can enter into a labour contract in Vietnam with salaries paid in foreign currency. Otherwise, for a Vietnamese, the local labour contract must be agreed in Vietnam dong.

Currently, the Labour Code is silent on the case whether a local contract with the Vietnamese entity is still required if a Vietnamese individual enters a contract with a foreign entity and is assigned to work for a Vietnamese entity on a secondment basis. Once again, if a local contract is set up, labour compliance must follow the Vietnamese Labour Code for a Vietnamese.

It is also worth noting that under the new Labour Code 2019, a labour contract is defined as an agreement between the employee and the employer on the work with paid wages/salary, labour condition, rights and obligation of each party in the labour regulations. In case the two parties enter into an agreement with a different name but the contents include the work with paid wages/salary and the control, management, supervision by one party, such agreement is considered a labour contract.

Corporate Income Tax (“CIT”)

Strictly under CIT regulations, in order to claim a CIT deduction, the levels and conditions of entitlement in relation to salaries, bonuses and any other employment benefits provided to employees are required to be documented in one of the following documents: labour contract, collective labour agreements, financial regulations, bonus schemes. 

Accordingly, in the case whereby the assignee enters into a legitimate labour contract with XYZ Vietnam (like a locally recruited employee), technically the employment cost of the assignee should be deductible for CIT for XYZ Vietnam (as to the extent the remunerations are clearly stated in such labour contract). 

However, in the case whereby the assignee does not enter into a labour contract with XYZ Vietnam and only the assignment letter from DEF is in place, there is inconsistency in the view between tax authorities as to whether the employment cost of the assignee is deductible for CIT purposes in the hands of XYZ Vietnam.  

Interpretation of the various OL’s and commentary from the Ministry of Finance can be taken broadly to disallow the cost if there is no labour contract. However, a literal interpretation of the letters does not preclude this specifically if other supporting documents are available. In this respect the fact a work permit has been issued and policies and agreements are in place to support the assignment will be necessary. However, the risk of non-deductibility remains.

Foreign Contractor Tax (“FCT”)

Foreign organizations doing business or earning income in Vietnam without setting up a legal entity shall be subject to FCT, which comprises an element of VAT and an element of CIT.

In the case where the salary expenses are recharged at cost (i.e. without a mark-up) and no service is being performed on a company to company basis, the Vietnamese tax authorities have issued a number of rulings confirming that FCT shall not be imposed on such pure reimbursement provided that there is a clear agreement between the Vietnamese company and the overseas company (normally known as a Reimbursement Agreement). 

In the contemplated arrangement, in addition to the reimbursement of the employment cost of the assignee, DEF intends to charge XYZ Vietnam an overhead charge of 5% over such compensation. 

Technically only the overhead charge which is assumed to cover the administration works of DEF should be subject to Vietnam FCT, whilst the employment cost portion (assuming that this does not contain a payment for a service provided by a third party) should not be subject to Vietnam FCT. 

However, given the regulations are unclear on this issue, and if DEF/ XYZ Vietnam were not able to convince the tax authority about the service scope for which the overhead fee is charged and the basis for which the 5% overhead charge is calculated, there is a possibility that the tax authority considers DEF to be leasing employees to XYZ Vietnam and impose FCT on the whole reimbursement amount as if DEF is providing services to XYZ Vietnam. 

In this regard, it is recommended that a confirmation on which portion of the payment from XYZ Vietnam to DEF is subject to FCT should be sought in advance to avoid unexpected challenge from the tax authorities (where applicable). 

Otherwise, a common approach by other companies for a similar arrangement is that the recharge should be arranged at cost (without any mark-up) in order to mitigate the FCT risk.

With respect of Permanent Establishment (“PE”) taxation issue, a PE is broadly defined under Vietnam CIT regulations. By assigning an employee to provide services in Vietnam or having a representative in Vietnam with authority to enter into contracts in the name of the foreign enterprise or regularly deliver goods or provides services in Vietnam, the foreign entity would be deemed to have a Vietnam PE and subject to Vietnam CIT regime. 

However, the practice so far has indicated that the Vietnamese tax authorities have rarely requested foreign companies to pay CIT based on the PE concept (i.e. identifying the income attributable to and the expenses allocated to the PE in Vietnam to arrive at the actual net profits). The reason could be that there are no regulations to support such assessment and the Vietnamese tax authorities do not want to be involved in the lengthy tax inspection to assess which expenses allocated from overseas to the PE in Vietnam are deductible, etc. Instead, the tax authorities prefer taxing foreign companies via the FCT regime referred to above. The FCT system generally allows the Vietnamese tax authorities to assess tax on foreign companies on a deemed basis.

Compulsory insurance - Social Health Unemployment Insurance (“SHUI”) 
	
From a SHUI perspective, the authority will look to the supporting documents detailing the employment arrangement to assess whether SHUI obligations arise. 

If the Employee has a local labour contract and voluntarily is treated as a Vietnamese, the Employee is required to participate in three types of compulsory insurance being Social Insurance, Health Insurance and Unemployment Insurance. 

As referred to above, where a Vietnamese is assigned to work in Vietnam by an overseas entity, there is no clear guidance whether a local contract is required to be set up in this case. Where there is no labour contract set up, it is arguable that no SHUI obligations apply. However, it should be further confirmed with the Social Insurance Authority.

For a foreigner, where a local labour contract is set up, generally the employee is required to participate in Social Insurance and Health Insurance. No Unemployment Insurance is applied to a foreigner. Where there is no labour contract there should be no SHUI obligations. 

Personal Income Tax (PIT)

In general, a Vietnamese Company has the obligation to withhold tax at source when paying salaries and equivalent.  

Referring to Clause 1, Article 25, Circular 111/2013/TT-BTC dated 15 August 2013, which stipulates:
“Article 25. Tax withholding and certificate of tax withheld at source
1. Tax withholding
Tax withholding is the income payer’s calculating and withholding the tax payable from the taxpayer’s income before paying the income to the taxpayer”.

The above has been interpretated to mean that only income paid directly from the local employer to the taxpayer under a labour contract is subject to PIT withholding. Accordingly, where the Employee will receive the income directly from DEF, XYZ Vietnam is not responsible to withhold PIT at source. Instead, PIT will be declared directly with the Vietnamese tax authority under individual tax return. 

However, there are different local practices and interpretations. Some tax authorities have expanded their interpretation to include the obligation to withhold PIT to all employment expenses where the Vietnam entity is the ultimate paying entity. In this case it would indicate that XYZ Vietnam is responsible to declare and withhold PIT at source for total income paid the employee including the recharged portion.

Although overall PIT liability remains the same whether through Company or Individual tax filing, the Company should consider between the current regulations and local practice and whether official confirmation should be sought. If PIT is withheld by XYZ Vietnam, it further supports the CIT deduction of recharged costs.

Also, under the current regulations, there are some favourable PIT treatments which are only available for a foreigner working in Vietnam such as tax exemption for tuition fee, one-off relocation, one round home leave airfare per year, etc… This is another matter considered to be treated as a Vietnamese or a foreigner for PIT purposes.

CONCLUSION

There is no clear guidance from many perspectives in relation to the management of a dual citizen working in Vietnam. Practically, we have observed many dual citizens working in Vietnam as a foreigner. All potential aspects should be considered.

Where the Employee adopts to be treated as a foreigner to work in Vietnam, the preference in many cases would be that the Employee continues to come on assignment and does NOT enter into a labour contract, often in line with global policy. The risks to be assessed in doing so can be summarised below:


Therefore, the risk of non-deductibility for CIT (after mitigation through documentation) needs to be weighed against the additional costs and compliance as a result of entering into a labour contract. 

Where the Employee is treated as a Vietnamese, the points to consider are as follows:

Immigration: no requirement. 

Labour: There is no clear indication if the individual comes in on assignment if a local labour contract is required. If required, it must follow by the Vietnamese Labour Code.

CIT: As above

FCT: As above

PIT: As above

SHUI: it is arguable that no liability to SHUI arises if there is no local labour contract set up. Further confirmation is recommended.
