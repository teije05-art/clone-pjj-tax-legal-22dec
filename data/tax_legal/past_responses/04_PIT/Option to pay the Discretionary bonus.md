Dear,

Pursuant to the terms of the Engagement Letter dated 09 February 2022 and the Annex dated 7 March 2022 between KPMG Tax and Advisory Limited (“KPMG”) and …, we set out in this Advice our comments on options to pay the discretionary bonus to the RO’s employee.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Based on the information provided in our correspondences and the Engagement Letter, we understand the following facts:

WAA is a company established under Singapore’ s regulations, which is wholly-owned by WA. Together with WAC, another wholly owned company by WA, the three companies form the group.

WAA established a Representative Office (“RO”) in Hanoi where it employed Ms. G, a Vietnam tax resident, as a Chief Representative. With excellent business results of the Group’s investment management activities in 2021, WAC is planning to reward Ms. G a share of the profits with the value of USD229,574.80 in accordance with the long-term compensation system of the company. The reward will be paid in full by either WAA or the RO. 

The preference of Ms. G and the Group is not to receive the bonus amount in cash at this stage but to reinvest the money in overseas investment fund which is advised by the Group.  To fully comply with the Vietnamese tax and legal regulations, the Company has sought KPMG’s advice on the possible options for arranging the mentioned reward to Ms. G. 

In light with the above and within the scope of this Advice, we outline hereunder four (04) options with the corresponding Vietnamese legal and Personal Income Tax (“PIT”) implications for your perusal.

LEGAL BASIS 
Our Advice presented below is based on the relevant regulations, which are currently in force in Vietnam as of the date of this advice. In particular, our Advice is mainly based on the legal documents listed in Appendix 1. 

DETAILED COMMENTS ON THE FOUR OPTIONS




In summary, the advatanges and disadvantages of the options are as follows:


Notes: 

Options 2, 3, 4 are more advantagous in terms of cashflow PIT payment due to the deferal of the taxing point. 
Option 2 if feasible would result in lower total PIT liability since part of the total payment is classified as capital gain or dividend which is subject to lower tax rates (0.1% and 5% respectively)

LIMITATION AND DISCLAIMER

The foregoing analysis is based on the facts provided to us, and we address only the inquiries and requests made pursuant to our discussion. 

Furthermore, Vietnamese law is in a state of flux due to macro changes in its economic and legal structures. As such, there are challenges in operating within this legal environment, including contradictions in and among various bodies of law, inconsistent interpretation or application of the law by the courts, licensing authorities and other regulatory bodies, and a general lack of clarity and specificity in the laws and regulations to address a number of matters and questions. 

The advice has been prepared based on the documents and information supplied by you and the current laws and regulations, which are issued by the competent authorities of Vietnam, as at the date of the advice.  The contents of this advice cannot be relied upon by any other party other than you.

You will appreciate that the laws are frequently being changed, both prospectively and retrospectively.  Whilst we will make every effort to inform you of changes in the law that might affect this advice, unless special arrangements are made, our advice provided will not be updated to take account of subsequent changes to the tax legislation, case law, rulings and determinations issued by the Vietnamese tax governing bodies or other practices of taxation authorities. We recommend that you should seek further advice or updates if you are to rely on our advice at a later date.

We are, of course, unable to give any guarantee that our interpretation will ultimately be sustained in the event of challenge by the Vietnamese tax authorities.

Please let us know if you have any questions or comments in respect of the above report.  

Yours sincerely,

APPENDIX 2: DETAILED LEGAL ANALYSIS 

Option 1: Bonus payment through payroll and reinvestment into a Luxembourg-domiciled fund 

Feasibility of implementation of direct outbound investment under the laws of Vietnam

The prevailing laws allow Vietnamese individuals to make a direct outbound investment upon completion of the main licensing procedures with Vietnamese authorities as below:
The investment plan has been approved by the MPI by an outbound investment registration certificate (“OIRC”); 
The schedule capital transfer has been successfully registered by the individual with the State Bank of Vietnam; and
The outbound investment has been promptly notified to relevant authorities: MPI, SBV, Vietnam Embassy in the host country.

An offshore direct investment shall be made by a Vietnamese individual under one of the following statutory forms:
Establishment of a business organization in accordance with the law of the host country;
Making investment on the basis of an overseas contract;
Contribution of capital to, purchase of shares or stakes of an overseas business organization to participate in management of such business organization;
Other forms of investment prescribed by law of the host country.

In addition to the above regulatory requirement, from practical perspective, MPI also has further assessment on (i) whether the foreign business organisation is a holding company; and (ii) the individual must participate in management of the foreign business. We observe that MPI has reject the application for outbound investment to a holding/investment fund company.

Given the fact that Ms. G will invest her money into a Luxembourg-domiciled fund, in light of the above analysis, this Option is unfeasible for implementation. 

Option 2: Share awards through Group’s share award scheme or acquiring shares issued by different foreign entities

Feasibility of implementation of share awards program under the laws of Vietnam

The prevailing laws allow Vietnamese individuals to make offshore indirect investment only in the form of participation in ESOP if satisfying the following principle:
The program that awards shares issued in foreign nations to Vietnamese employees will be only implemented after being successful registered by the program executing organization with the State Bank of Vietnam (“SBV”).
Earnings from sale of shares and/or share options of Vietnamese employees, dividends and other lawful incomes in foreign currency must be transferred to Vietnamese employees via the foreign currency account opened by the program executing organization at a licensed credit institution in Vietnam.
The execution of share awarding program must comply with regulations on foreign exchange control, payment of personal income tax and other relevant laws.
Pursuant to Circular 10, the program executing organization is a Vietnamese presence of the ESOP issuer under the following forms:
foreign invested economic organization; 
branch;
representative office; or
operating offices of foreign party to a business cooperation contract.

The relevant regulations (Decree 135 and Circular 10) do not explicitly stipulate that the shares under the ESOP must be issued by the ESOP issuer which has a presence in Vietnam. Given this, it might be interpreted that the shares granted under WAA’s ESOP might be issued by WA instead of WAA as long as the share issuer has an ownership relationship with the ESOP issuer. However, from our verbal check on a no-name basis with the SBV, the SBV adopts a strict view that the shares should be issued by the ESOP issuer having presence in Vietnam (i.e. WAA)

In light with the above, as Ms. G is employed under the RO of WAA, the shares under WAA’s ESOP should be issued by WAA and registered by the WAA’s RO with the SBV before implementation.

Where under scenario (ii), WAA is not a share issuer but it acquires share from another foreign issuer (i.e. ACCESS S.A.) to grant to Ms. G as a bonus, the ESOP of such foreign issuer registered by the WAA’s RO will likely be rejected by the SBV. Thus, this option is not feasible.

Licensing procedures for registration and during the implementation of the share award program with the SBV

The typical application dossier includes:

Written registration of implementation of the bonus shares program; 
Documents proving legal status of the foreign organization having the bonus share program (such as certificate of incorporation, biz profile);
Investment registration certificate/ establishment and operation registration certificate of the program executing organization or other documents of equivalent;
Written documents describing the detailed contents of the bonus shares program;
List of Vietnamese employees participating in the bonus shares program; and
Any other documents as required at SBV’s discretion during the appraisal of the bonus shares program.

The statutory timeline for SBV to issue the registration certification is fifteen (15) working days from its receipt of proper application file. However, the timing in practice should be expected to be longer given that additional information and/or documents are frequently requested by SBV. As at the date hereof, no governmental fees or charges are applicable for the registration of bonus shares program.

During the implementation of the bonus shares program, the program executing organization is required to submit the quarterly report to SBV on the status of implementation of the bonus shares program in the prescribed form no later than the 20th day since the end of each quarter.

APPENDIX 3: PHANTOM SHARE SCHEME 

Per our understanding: 

Phantom share is a form of employee compensation scheme that gives employees access to stock ownership without actually owning the stock. Employees are compensated with profits incurred from any company stock appreciation on specific dates. 

Phantom stocks are becoming increasingly prevalent as part of a total compensation package. The concept of this plan initially applies to the employer’s stock. However, there is no limitation under Vietnam prevailing law on the application for granting shadow stock of other companies. 

The number of phantom shares given to an employee in this case could often depend on reward value determined by the Company. A “delay mechanism” kicks in when phantom stocks are awarded. The actual financial pay-out is made after a long period, such as two to five years, but it depends on the agreement made between the company and the employees. 

Under Vietnam’s current regulation, there is no specific guidance on the tax treatment of phantom stock. However, based on the nature of this plan, we would like to comment on the tax implication as below:
