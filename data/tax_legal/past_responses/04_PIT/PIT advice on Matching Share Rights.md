Purpose
A Group Limited (A) is reviewing global obligations in relation to its employee share scheme regarding its existing equity arrangements as well as future equity arrangements to be granted to employees.  Relevant details are as follows: 
A’s eligible employees are able to purchase ordinary shares in the Company with their net take home income. The purchase period is a six months period and the shares will be acquired on a monthly basis.
Under the remuneration framework, A offers equity awards via a matching share plan where Participants will receive a share right for every three shares acquired. These rights will vest six months after the date of grant, subject to the Participant’s continued employment and provided they do not dispose of their acquired shares. 
The funds will be provided to the share trust, the shared trust will purchase the shares and immediately transfer them to the nominee who holds on behalf of the employees.
Key areas
The high-level regulatory requirements are summarised in section 3 in respect of the following:
Tax implications in Vietnam. This includes the tax point, tax rate, tax treatment, and taxable income regulated by the local tax authority;
Obligations payable in addition to income tax. This includes social security, health insurance and pension contributions and requirement for share scheme registration; 
Unusual obligations for employees. This includes disclosure requirements required by the individual (rather than A). Information on the items included in this section will also be provided in the individual employee tax inserts when prepared (refer below); and  
The company reporting requirements of the tax declaration form and deadline. This includes disclosure requirements required by A. 
As previously agreed with the Global Head of Remuneration, we have focussed on Vietnamese local tax implications for the purposes of the initial “due diligence”.
Overview of regulatory requirements (tax)
We set out below an overview of key regulatory tax requirements in respect of Vietnam. The below summary assumes that the individuals are the Vietnamese tax residents and are employees of the Vietnam entity (i.e. not contractors or otherwise).
