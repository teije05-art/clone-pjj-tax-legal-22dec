ADVICE ON VIETNAMESE PERSONAL INCOME TAX IMPLICATIONS FOR EXPATRIATES WORKING IN VIETNAM


Dear Mr….,
In line with our Engagement Letter dated ……, we set out below our advice on Vietnamese Personal Income Tax (“PIT”) implications and our recommendations for PIT cost optimisation in relation to the remuneration structure of the expatriates assigned by the Company from Australia to work in Vietnam.
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Based on the information provided, we summarize below our understanding of the facts and arrangement of the Company. Please review it carefully as any changes to the background may have a material impact on our comments.
ABC is a company incorporated in Australia. To provide services to XYZ, a Vietnamese company, ABC would assign some employees from Australia to Vietnam to work on a temporary basis;
The expatriates are expected to stay in Vietnam for more than 182 days in any calendar years from 2021;
As they leave Australia temporarily and do not set up a permanent home in Vietnam and would physically be present in Australia for 183 days during the Australian income tax year, i.e. from 1 July to 30 June, they are likely qualified as tax residents for PIT purpose in Australia;




Their Australian local contracts remain in place and they do not have an employment relationship with the Vietnamese company;
They continue to be remunerated by the Australian entity for the activities they will perform in Vietnam and taxed in Australia as tax residents;
While working for the Vietnam project, they also perform other duties for ABC;
For the purpose of advice, ABC provided us with sample employment agreements between the Company and one expatriate for us to understand his working duties and remuneration package.  Based on the employment agreements, the expatriate’s income package includes salary, share options (LTI and STI), additional benefits like superannuation premium, laptop, mobile phone, expense reimbursement, unpaid leave payment upon termination of employment, etc.) The income is paid exclusively from Australia, no income is paid from Vietnam
As requested, we provide advice on PIT implications of the above arrangement under the domestic laws of Vietnam. We also comment on the potential tax relief opportunities under the tax treaty between Vietnam and Australia (“DTA”), including the necessary procedures for the application of tax relief in Vietnam and other recommendations for Vietnam tax efficiency purpose.
Limitation of scope:
PIT in Vietnam is imposed on various types of income, including but not only limited to employment income, business income, capital gain, income from capital investment, etc. Under the scope of this advice, we will limit our comments on PIT implications on income incurred based on the employment relationship between the expatriates and ABC only;
The advice covers comments on statutory obligations of the Company and expatriates from the Vietnam perspective and does not cover any statutory obligations (if any) arising overseas for the arrangement;
LEGAL BASIS
Our comments presented below are based on the information and documents provided by the Company and the relevant regulations, which are currently in force in Vietnam as of the date of this advice. Particularly, our advice is mainly based on the legal documents listed in Appendix I.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The expatriates of ABC assigned to work in Vietnam will be subject to Vietnamese PIT. PIT is assessed on (i) tax residency status and (ii) income source of the expatriates;
PIT liabilities are declared and paid on withholding at source principle, i.e. income paying body will be responsible to withhold, declare and pay PIT imposed on the income they pay to individual taxpayers. However, as ABC is a foreign entity, the above principle does not apply, instead, PIT imposed on the income paid by ABC will be declared under the expatriates’ individual tax codes;




Where the expatriates perform work in Vietnam, PIT exemption under the DTA between Vietnam and Australia may be applicable if all of the four (04) conditions are simultaneously met:
(a) The individual is present in Vietnam for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in the year of income of Vietnam; and
(b) The remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of Vietnam; and
(c) the remuneration is not deductible in determining taxable profits of a permanent establishment or a fixed base which the employer has in Vietnam; and
(d) the remuneration is subject to tax in Australia.
Conditions (a) and (c) might not be satisfied, the chance for PIT exemption in Vietnam is considered to be low. 
Alternatively, ABC may consider the tax relief by way of applying for tax credit under the DTA, by which the tax paid in Vietnam may be credited against the tax payable in Australia if they are Australian tax residents in the relevant tax year or credit of tax paid in Australia against the tax payable in Vietnam if they are Vietnamese tax residents.
Recommendations: to optimize the Vietnamese PIT cost for the expatriates, ABC may consider to:
Plan for the expatriates to be taxed under the tax non-resident status, thus reducing their taxable income base and tax rate; or
Apply for tax credit under the Vietnamese or Australian regulations or under the DTA; or
Restructure the income package of the expatriates by utilizing the tax concessional treatment under Vietnamese PIT regulations to reduce their taxable income and relevant PIT liabilities.
OUR COMMENTS
PIT implications under Vietnamese regulations
Overview Employment income
Under the current Vietnamese PIT regulations, the Vietnamese PIT obligation of an individual is assessed primarily based on his/her tax residency status, income source and tax rates.
An individual will be treated as a Vietnamese tax resident if any one of the following conditions are satisfied:
being physically present in Vietnam for 183 days or more in a calendar year or during the 12 consecutive month period from his/her first arrival date in Vietnam; or
having a “permanent residence” in Vietnam including a place registered for regular residency or a rented place with the term of 183 days or longer in a tax year; or




having a “permanent residence” in Vietnam as mentioned above but being present in Vietnam for less than 183 days in a tax year while being unable to prove that he is a tax resident under another jurisdiction during the same period.
Otherwise, he/she will be treated as a tax non-resident of Vietnam.
Tax residents are taxed on the world-wide income at progressive tax rates (ranging from 5% to 35%) while tax non-residents (including those who are not present in Vietnam) are taxed on the Vietnam sourced income at the flat rate (currently 20%).
The current regulations are unclear as to the definition of “Vietnam sourced income”. In practice it is commonly interpreted by the local tax authorities that Vietnam sourced income is income resulted from performing works sourced from Vietnam.
Where Vietnam sourced income is not provided separately, it will be determined by prorating the individuals’ annual income over their number of staying days in Vietnam (in case of being present in Vietnam) or number of working days for Vietnam project (in case of not being present in Vietnam) in the relevant tax year;
Whilst PIT is a liability of the employee, the onus to withhold and remit the PIT is with the employer in Vietnam. Upon the payment of the employment income to the individual, the employer must withhold, file and remit the PIT withholding to the Vietnamese tax authority on behalf of the individual.
Where the employer is an overseas entity, the employee is responsible to file and settle the PIT directly with the Vietnamese tax authority.
During the year, PIT on employment income paid by an overseas employer is required to be filed by the employee on a quarterly basis. PIT on employment income paid by a Vietnamese employer is required to be withheld and filed by the Vietnamese employer on a monthly or quarterly basis.
Tax residents having tax paid in overseas on income sourced from overseas are entitled to tax credit, subject to the availability of supporting documents and explanation of the overseas sourced income. Tax credit is not applicable to tax non-residents.
The PIT finalization (on world-wide income) at the year-end or upon the expatriates’ completion of assignment and leaving Vietnam is applicable for those being tax residents of Vietnam.
For further details on the principles of taxation in Vietnam, please refer to Appendix II.
Income from capital gain/capital investment (dividends)
Where employees are granted share options, they will be subject to Vietnam PIT on capital gain at the time the share options/the purchased shares are transferred. The taxing of share options as employment income is unclear under the current regulations;
In addition, dividends paid to the individual as the shareholder is subject to PIT on income from capital investment;
With respect to income from capital gain, transferring of purchased shares/share options is subject to Vietnamese PIT with tax rate 0.1% on the proceeds;




The dividends payable to the individual are subject to PIT at the rate of 5% of the dividend value;
For tax residents, tax will be imposed on the total proceeds or dividends as being worldwide income. Currently, the PIT regulations are silent on tax credit principles for non- employment income like capital gain or dividend but tax administration regulations do have a provision on procedures for tax credit on all kinds of income, including capital gain or dividends. However, under the draft circular guiding tax administration regulations, which is expected to be issued soon, the procedures for tax credit under the domestic taxing rules for all kinds of income have been removed. As such, it is unclear whether the tax credit for capital gain or dividends can be applied under domestic regulations or must be claimed under the DTA, which procedures are more complicated;
For tax non-residents, PIT is imposed on Vietnam-sourced income only, which might be determined by prorating the total proceeds/dividends for the working period of the expatriates in Vietnam over the total working period entitled to share options. Tax credit is not applicable to tax non-residents, similar to employment income.
Implications for the expatriates of ABC Employment income
As the expatriates would stay in Vietnam for 183 days or more in any calendar year from 2021, they will be considered as tax residents in Vietnam and taxed on their worldwide income with progressive tax rates ranging from 5% to 35%;
Taxable income includes salary, voluntary superannuation premium, unpaid leave payment. Other benefits such as laptop, mobile phone and expense reimbursement are also taxable if they are deemed as benefits of the expatriates;
Tax credit: Technically, the tax paid in Australia for the income derived overseas of a tax resident can be creditable against tax payable in Vietnam on a proportion basis. The creditable amount shall not exceed the tax payable on the income derived overseas according to Vietnamese tax regulations. For clarity, income derived overseas is interpreted as income received by the expatriates for overseas related works, not relevant to Vietnam.
In order to effect the tax credit, the income portion derived in Vietnam and overseas should be split based on certain criteria, such as ratio of responsibilities/duties between the work for Vietnam project and that for Australia/other countries. ABC may consider to make an Annex to the current employment agreement with the expatriates to capture the income split and the related criteria of the split.
Under unpredictable circumstances where the expatriates may stay in Vietnam for less than 183 days and do not hold a permanent residential place in Vietnam for 183 days or more in a tax year, e.g. in the departure year from Vietnam or during Covid-19 pandemic where they have to work remotely from Australia, they will be considered as tax non-residents in Vietnam and subject to Vietnamese PIT on their Vietnam-sourced income with flat tax rate of 20%, irrespective of where the income is paid;
Where Vietnam sourced income is not provided separately, e.g. for the case of Mr Patrick Chang where his annual income is quoted on a lump sum amount for his worldwide duties, the Vietnam sourced income will be determined by prorating their annual income over their number of staying days in Vietnam (in case of being present in Vietnam) or number of




working days for Vietnam project (in case of not being present in Vietnam) in the relevant tax year;
Tax credit under domestic regulations is not applicable to those who are considered as tax non-residents in Vietnam.
Income from capital gain/dividends
If the expatriates sell share options/purchased shares or receive dividends during their working period in Vietnam in a tax year where they are tax residents, they shall be taxed fully on the total proceeds/dividends. The chance for credit of tax paid in Australia under the domestic regulations is unclear under the draft circular on tax administration;
Under circumstances where the expatriates turn into tax non-residents and sell share options/purchased shares or receive dividends in the relevant tax year, PIT shall be imposed on the proceeds/dividends portion corresponding to their working period in Vietnam. Tax credit shall not be applied.
Possibility of tax relief under the DTA between Vietnam and Australia
The expatriates of ABC may enjoy tax relief under the DTA signed between Vietnam and Australia by way of (i) tax exemption or (ii) tax credit.
Of note, the determination of whether the expatriates are residents of Australia will be based on the criteria as provided under the domestic regulations of Australia.
Employment income
Tax exemption
An individual tax resident of Australian may be entitled to PIT exemption in Vietnam if:
(A) The individual’s work is exercised in Australia, i.e. he/she is not present in Vietnam; or
(B) If the individual is present in Vietnam, the following four (04) conditions must simultaneously be met:
The individual is present in Vietnam for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in the year of income of Vietnam; and
The remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of Vietnam; and
the remuneration is not deductible in determining taxable profits of a permanent establishment or a fixed base which the employer has in Vietnam; and
the remuneration is subject to tax in Australia.
As the expatriates coming to work in Vietnam, the PIT exemption under (A) is not applicable. For the conditions under (B), we provide hereunder our comments on each condition based on the context of ABC:
Presence in Vietnam for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in the year of income of Vietnam




As most of the expatriates are expected to stay in Vietnam for 182 days or more in any calendar year from 2021, they do not qualify for this condition and PIT exemption under DTA is therefore not applicable. In unpredictable circumstances where their number of residence days in Vietnam fall under 183 days and they do not hold a permanent residential place/a Temporary Resident Card (“TRC”) in Vietnam for more than 182 days in a tax year, they may qualify for PIT exemption if the remaining conditions are met.
The remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident in Vietnam
In the Circular 205/2013/TT-BTC guiding the application of DTAs, the term “employer” is referred to as “real employer”. Cases where a person is regarded as a real employer are as follows:
That person has rights on products and services created by the employee and bears the responsibility and risks for such labor; or
That person gives instructions and supplies working tools to the employee; or
That person is entitled to control and bears the responsibility for the working place.
Based on information provided by the Company, we understand that the Employment Agreement between the Company and the expatriates shall remain in force during their working in Vietnam, i.e. ABC remains as employer of the expatriates during their Vietnam assignment period. The expatriates’ working in Vietnam is to provide service to Ban Phuc Nickel Mines, which is a part of the expatriates’ overall duties under their Employment Agreement with ABC. While working for the Vietnam project, they also perform other duties for ABC with direct reporting line to ABC’s management. That said, it is understood that ABC is the party who has rights on services performed by the expatriates and bears the responsibility and risks for such services, as well as being the party who gives instructions for the expatriates’ work. In line with the guidance under Circular 205, ABC could likely be considered as “real employer” of the expatriates during their assignment period. In that case, condition (b) is likely to be met.
the remuneration is not deductible in determining taxable profits of a permanent establishment or a fixed base which the employer has in Vietnam
The key consideration under this condition is whether or not the services performed by the expatriates in Vietnam would give rise to a permanent establishment (“PE”) of ABC in Vietnam;
Under Article 5 of the DTA, the term "permanent establishment", in relation to an enterprise, means a fixed place of business through which the business of the enterprise is wholly or partly carried on.
Under Article 11 of Circular 205, an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be regarded to have a PE in Vietnam if it satisfies the following three conditions:
Maintaining in Vietnam an “establishment”, for example a building, an office or part thereof, a means or equipment, etc.; and
This establishment must be fixed, i.e. it must be established at a specified place and/or maintained on a permanent basis. The fixedness of a business establishment does not




necessarily mean that such establishment must be attached to a specific geographical point for a certain length of time; and
The enterprise carries on wholly or partly business activities through this establishment.
Where ABC sends a number of expatriates to perform services in Vietnam continuously over a number of years with the residing days of each expatriate being 182 days or more in any calendar year from 2021, referring to the above mentioned three conditions of PE constitution, it is likely that ABC would be deemed to carry out part of its business through a PE in Vietnam.
Per our observation of the local tax authority’s interpretation, as long as the PE of ABC is deemed to exist, the remuneration of the expatriates is likely to be considered as borne by the PE, under which circumstance, condition (c) is not satisfied.
The remuneration is subject to tax in Australia
We understand that this condition is met as the expatriates continue to be taxed as tax residents in Australia.
Based on the above analysis, the chance to claim PIT exemption in Vietnam under the DTA is considered to be low.
Tax credit
Where the tax exemption is not available under the DTAs, the double taxation can be eliminated by way of tax credit (provided for under Article 23 of the DTA), according to which, tax paid in Australia can be credited against tax payable by the expatriates in Vietnam if they are Vietnamese tax residents. The creditable tax amount, however, shall not exceed the amount of the Vietnamese tax computed in accordance with Vietnamese tax regulations.
Alternatively, the tax paid in Vietnam may also be allowed to be credited against any Australian tax computed on the same income, subject to the provisions of the laws of Australia where the expatriates are considered as tax residents of Australia
It is noted that where tax credit under DTA is applied, it should be applied in one country only, i.e. either Vietnam or Australia, not both.
Income from capital gain/dividends
According to Article 10 of the DTA, dividends paid by an Australian resident company to a Vietnamese resident individual can be taxed in both countries but the tax so charged shall not exceed 10% of the gross amount of the dividends in Vietnam and 15% in Australia. Whereas the tax rate for dividend under Vietnamese PIT regulations is only 5%, applying DTA does not offer any tax relief for this kind of income from Vietnam perspective;
Taxation on capital gain is governed under Article 13of the DTA. In particular, taxation on income from share transfer is provided under paragraphs 4 and 5, whereby the taxing rules under the domestic laws of each country would apply (paragraph 5), with an exception provided under paragraph 4, where the transfer by a resident of a Contracting State (e.g. Vietnam) of the shares in a company, the assets of which consists wholly or principally of real property situated in the other Contracting State (e.g. Australia), the income derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State (Australia). Accordingly, in ABC’s case, from




the Vietnamese tax perspective, taxation on the proceeds from share transfer will follow the domestic regulations, as commented above.
According to Article 23 of the DTA on methods of elimination of double taxation, tax paid in Vietnam under Vietnamese regulations and in accordance with the DTA of an Australian tax resident can be creditable against Australian tax payable in respect of that income.
On the other hand, where a tax resident of Vietnam derives income which under the law of Australia and in accordance with the DTA may be taxed in Australia, Vietnam shall allow as a credit against its tax on the income an amount equal to the tax paid in Australia.
Of note, tax credit under the DTA only applies to tax residents of the Contracting States. In case the expatriates are considered as tax residents of both Vietnam and Australia, their residency status must be determined using the tie-breakers provided under Article 4 of the DTA for DTA application purpose.
It is noteworthy that the DTA application is not an automatic procedure. In order to apply tax treatments under the DTA which prevail those under domestic regulations, taxpayers must lodge notification/application dossiers to the local tax authorities for their assessment. Incorrect assessments by taxpayers could result in retrospective tax adjustments with penalties being applied on any shortfall tax and interest on late tax payment.
Please refer to Appendix III for more details about application dossiers for tax exemption and tax credit under the DTA.
Recommendations for tax cost optimization
To the extent possible, ABC may consider the followings to minimize the PIT liability in Vietnam:
With respect to tax exemption under the DTA, as analysed under Section 4.1.2, the PIT exemption under DTA is unlikely given the residing periods of the expatriates and the PE exposure of ABC in Vietnam. Hence the Company may consider to utilize the tax credit method under either Vietnamese or Australian regulations for employment income and tax credit under DTA for capital gain and dividends;
Where the expatriates’ working duration in Vietnam can be planned such that their staying period in Vietnam is less than 183 days in the relevant tax year, they shall be taxed on Vietnam-sourced income only with tax rate 20% instead of progressive tax rate up to 35%. The Company may need to compare tax liabilities under Vietnamese tax non-resident circumstance and Vietnamese tax resident circumstance with tax credit for planning purpose;
Where a part of income package of the expatriates can be carved out to park under the shelter of concessional treatment under Vietnamese PIT regulations, the PIT liabilities of the expatriates may be reduced through the decreased taxable income, subject to satisfaction of relevant required conditions and supporting documents. For example, with respect to the income package of Mr Patrick Chang, for the items such as laptop, mobile phone and expense reimbursement, if there are Company’s policy and other supporting documents which can prove their business expense nature rather than personal benefit, they would not be subject to PIT in Vietnam.




For your reference, we outline in Appendix IV the PIT concessional treatment of certain income items.
IMPORTANT NOTES
We have only been requested to advice on the Vietnamese regulatory consequences associated with the above circumstance; therefore our advice focuses on current and prevailing laws and regulations within the Socialist Republic of Vietnam at the time of the issues and will not consider issues belonging to other tax jurisdictions.
This advice has been prepared based on the documents and information supplied by the Company to KPMG and relevant laws and regulations which are issued by the relevant authorities of Vietnam, as at the date of our advice. Where regulations are quoted in English, the quotation may be from an unofficial KPMG translation of the source document and may not an official translation. You will appreciate that laws are frequently being changed, both prospectively and retrospectively. A number of key reform measures have been implemented, while a number of other key reforms have been deferred and the status of certain further key reforms remains unclear at this stage.
Unless special arrangements are made, our advice will not be updated to take account of subsequent changes to tax legislation, case law, rulings and determinations issued by the Vietnamese tax governing bodies or other practices of the taxation authorities. It is your responsibility to seek further advice or updates if you are to rely on our advice at a later date.
We are, of course, unable to give any guarantee that our interpretation will ultimately be sustained in the event of a challenge by the Vietnamese tax authorities.
We trust the above is clear and helpful. Should you need any further clarification regarding the above, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Yours sincerely

APPENDIX I – LEGAL BASIS




APPENDIX II – PERSONAL INCOME TAX HIGHLIGHTS
In Vietnam, PIT is imposed on various types of income, including but not only limited to employment income, business income, capital gain, income from capital investment etc.
Residency status
An expatriate will be treated as a tax resident in Vietnam if:
being physically present in Vietnam for 183 days or more in a calendar year or during the 12 consecutive month period from his first arrival date in Vietnam; or
having a “permanent residence” in Vietnam including a place registered for regular residency or a rented place with the term of 183 days or longer in a tax year; or
having a “permanent residence” in Vietnam as mentioned above but being present in Vietnam for less than 183 days in a tax year while being unable to prove that he is a tax resident under another jurisdiction during the same period.
Otherwise, he will be treated as a tax non-resident of Vietnam
Tax residency is determined on a year-to-year basis.
Assessable income & tax rates
Tax residents:
Tax residents are subject to Vietnamese PIT on their worldwide employment income at progressive tax rates ranging from 5% to 35%.
Detailed progressive tax rates for tax residents in Vietnam are as follows:

Note: N: Net take home - family circumstance relief; G: Taxable income; T: PIT
Deductions for family circumstance:
a personal relief of VND11,000,000/month; and
dependent relief of VND4,400,000/month/dependent (if applicable) which are allowed to be deducted from the assessable income provided that some registration procedures




are completed and adequate supporting documents proving the dependency are submitted within the statutory deadlines.
Other allowable deductions: Compulsory Health Insurance contributed in Vietnam (if any) and compulsory contributions in the country of which the expatriates hold nationality or where they work which are of the same nature of social insurance, health insurance, unemployment and professional liability insurances in Vietnam.
Tax non-residents:
Tax non-residents are subject to Vietnamese PIT on their Vietnam sourced income at the flat tax rate of 20 %.
Vietnam sourced income is defined as the income derived from performing works in Vietnam or performing works for duties in Vietnam, regardless of where the income is paid from (i.e. from overseas or from Vietnam). In case where Vietnam sourced income cannot be determined, the expatriate’s worldwide income will be prorated to arrive at the Vietnam sourced income as follows:
For non-tax resident who does not have presence in Vietnam


For other cases


Note:
Worldwide income (both employment and non-employment) is inclusive of income earned in Vietnam and overseas, irrespective of where the income is paid
Total of working days in a year is in accordance with the Vietnamese Labour code
Number of residence days in Vietnam is the total number of days the expatriate is present in Vietnam during the tax year. Arrival date and departure date are calculated as one day
Tax administration
Individual tax codes and dependent relief registration
Each individual taxpayer is required to apply for a Vietnamese tax code prior to his starting of PIT declaration in Vietnam.




Where taxpayers wish to apply the deduction for family circumstances (applicable to Vietnamese tax-resident only), a registration of dependents to the tax authorities is required.
Tax filing and payment
Resident taxpayers receiving income from overseas are subject to quarterly PIT declaration and PIT finalisation at the end of the tax year (calendar year or first 12 month period in Vietnam) or upon termination of his assignment/ employment contract. Specifically:
PIT finalisation:
On a calendar year basis (from January to December or from the first arrival month to December in case the expatriates comes from a country having a DTA with Vietnam): Expatriates being present in Vietnam for 183 days or more in the first calendar year;
On a 12-month basis from first arrival date in Vietnam: Expatriates being present in Vietnam for less than 183 days in the first calendar year, but for 183 days or more in their first 12-month period in Vietnam;
From the 2nd tax year onwards, PIT finalisation will be on a calendar year basis.
Non-resident taxpayers are subject to quarterly PIT declaration only.
The deadlines for PIT declaration filing and PIT payment are as follows:
Quarterly declaration: no later than the last day of the first month following the quarter;
Finalization at tax year-end: no later than 120th day from the end of the calendar year or 90th day of the first 12-month period; and
Termination of assignment/employment contract:
For tax residents: Under the current regulations, a taxpayer must finalise his/her PIT liability before departure from Vietnam. However, if such work cannot be done before his/her departure, he/she is allowed to authorize another individual or organization to finalise his/her tax liability within 45 days from the departure date.
For tax non-residents: It is not very clearly regulated whether the settlement of PIT must be completed before the tax payer’s departure date or the deadline for quarterly declaration and payment will apply. For prudence purposes, PIT declaration in connection with the termination and outstanding PIT should be settled as soon as possible.
Penalties in case of violation of tax administration procedures
Similar to other taxes, where PIT liability is not declared and paid on a timely manner, the following administrative penalties will be imposed on the taxpayer:
For organisation:
Late filing up to 90 days: a penalty of up to VND15 million;




Late filing more than 90 days: a penalty of up to VND25 million. For individual:
Half of the above noted penalty shall be applied for individual tax declaration.
Late payment of tax: Interest charge on outstanding tax amount at 0.03% per day.
Late payment of penalty: Interest charge on outstanding penalty at 0.05% per day.
Under-declaration of tax: At 20% of the tax shortfall.
Tax evasion: Up to three times the outstanding tax liability. Tax evasion is defined to include the submission of tax returns more than 90 days after the deadline.




APPENDIX III – APPLICATION DOSSIER FOR TAX EXEMTION AND TAX CREDIT UNDER THE DTA
Notification of PIT exemption under DTA
For individuals being residents of foreign countries, fifteen (15) days before performingcontracts with Vietnamese organizations or individuals, foreigners shall send dossiers on notification of eligibility for tax exemption or reduction under the DTA to Vietnamese contracting or income-paying parties. The individual can prepare and submit the application dossier directly to the tax authority for their assessment. The statute of limitation for DTA application is three (03) years.
A dossier comprises of:
A notification of eligibility for tax exemption or reduction under the DTA, Form No. 01/HTQT;
The original (or certified true copy) of the Certificate of Residence granted by a tax agency of the country of residence in the year preceding the year of notification of eligibility for tax exemption or reduction under the DTA, which has been legalized and translated into Vietnamese;
Copy of legal document certifying the source of income, with signature by the individuals to commit that they shall take responsibility therefor;
Copy of the passport used for entry into or exit from Vietnam, certified by the taxpayer;
Letter of authorization where the taxpayer authorises a representative to carry out procedures for tax exemption notification.
Please note that the DTA implementation in Vietnam is often subject to interpretations by the local tax authority which could result in further enquiries and additional documents required by the tax authorities.
Credit of PIT paid in overseas against Vietnamese PIT liability under DTA
Generally, organisations/individuals that are Vietnamese residents and have paid tax in a country that signs a DTA with Vietnam in accordance with that country’s laws and the DTA shall be allowed for the credit of tax paid in that country against Vietnamese PIT liability. The taxpayer shall submit an application for credit of tax paid in overseas to the local tax authority where its tax code is registered.
The procedure is as follows:
A written request for credit of tax paid in overseas against the tax payable in Vietnam (Form 02/HTQT), providing information about the transactions related to the paid tax which is deductible from tax payable in Vietnam.
A photocopy of the tax declaration of overseas income certified by the taxpayer;
Photocopies of overseas tax receipts certified by the taxpayer;
The original certificate of tax paid in overseas issued by the overseas tax authority;




A letter of power attorney if the taxpayer authorizes a representative to apply the procedure.
