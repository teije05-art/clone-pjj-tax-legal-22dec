Possibility for tax relief under the Double Tax Agreement


Tax exemption
Under the current Vietnamese tax regulations, where Vietnam enters into a DTA with a contracting country, provisions agreed under the DTA will prevail in cases where differences exist between the domestic laws and the DTA. For the contemplated capital transfer, Vietnam – Singapore DTA and Vietnam – the UK DTA and might be referred to respectively.
Possibility for tax exemption under Vietnam – Singapore DTA
Pursuant to Paragraph 4, Article 13 (Capital gains) of Vietnam – Singapore DTA which was amended by Article VII, Announcement No. 05/2013/TB-LPQT:
“Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of shares, other than shares of a company posted on a recognized stock exchange of one or both Contracting States, deriving more than 50% of their value directly or indirectly from immovable property situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.”
That said, under Vietnam - Singapore DTA, as THE VIETNAMESE COMPANY’s shares are not posted on a recognized stock exchange of both Vietnam and Singapore, gain from capital transfer will be taxed in Vietnam if THE VIETNAMESE COMPANY’s assets consist, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of immovable property situated in Vietnam (i.e. the ratio of immovable property).
Regarding the calculation of the ratio of immovable properties of THE VIETNAMESE COMPANY:
In accordance with Point 4, Article 27, Circular 205/2013/TT-BTC dated 24 December 2013 of Ministry of Finance, providing the guidance on the DTA implementation regarding the capital transfer:
“Ratio of immovable property value in total properties of enterprise is simple average of ratios of immovable property value in total properties of enterprise at time of transfer of property, the beginning time and ending time of tax year prior to year when the shares are transferred. Determination of immovable property value is based on the audited summary of properties of enterprise at the aforesaid times.
The principal ratio of immovable property value in total properties of enterprise is determined as follows: “… Where Agreement specifies the rate or principal rate, complying with the rate prescribed in Agreement”.
We hereafter present our approach to determine the value of immovable property as follows:
Pursuant to Clause 2, Article 6 of the Vietnam – Singapore DTA, the term "immovable property" shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated.
Pursuant to Circular 205, in the case of Vietnam, immovable property includes:
Types of assets as stipulated under definition of immovable property of Civil Code and Law on Real Estate Trading;
Sub-assets attached to these aforementioned assets;
Livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry;
Rights applied under law on land in Vietnam; 
Rights to enjoy payments for the natural resource exploitation or the right to exploit natural resources.
As provided under Article 107 of the Civil Code of Vietnam, immovable property includes:
Land;
Houses and constructions attached to land;
Other property attached to land, houses and constructions; 
Other property as prescribed by law”
Pursuant to Official Letter No. 2345/TCT-HTQT dated 16 June 2015 issued by General Department of Taxation, “machinery and equipment that are not attached to the factory on a regular and permanent basis and that are able to be moved inside/outside the factory for manufacturing purposes will not be considered as immovable property or sub-assets attached to immovable properties
Per the provided Financial Statements of THE VIETNAMESE COMPANY for the financial year 2019, we note that THE VIETNAMESE COMPANY’s assets mainly include the IT equipment, office equipment, furniture and fixtures, vehicles, construction in progress related to IT projects which are not attached to the buildings. If this is the case, these assets are highly likely not considered as immovable properties to be included into immovable property test for tax exemption purposes. On that basis, the ratio of immovable properties in the total assets of THE VIETNAMESE COMPANY at the beginning time and ending time of tax year prior to year when the shares are transferred (i.e. 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2019) is likely less than 50%. Please let us know if our understanding is not correct.
Please note that the ratio as at the capital transfer date would also be used for this calculation purpose. (Note, in practice, the capital transfer date is the date the amended Business License of THE VIETNAMESE COMPANY are issued by the MOF). We understand that for the period from 31 December 2019 to the expected capital transfer date, it is expected that THE VIETNAMESE COMPANY will not have any significant transaction relating to immovable properties; therefore, the average ratio would likely less than 50%. Please let us know if otherwise. 
With the above assessment, the average ratio of immovable property over the total properties of THE VIETNAMESE COMPANY is likely less than 50%. As such, gain from capital transfer in THE VIETNAMESE COMPANY by the transferor will not be taxed in Vietnam under Article 13 of Vietnam - Singapore DTA.

Possibility for tax exemption under Vietnam – the UK DTA
Pursuant to Clause 2, Article 13 (Capital gains) of Vietnam – the UK DTA:
“Article 13: Capital gains
(2) Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of:
(a) shares deriving their value or the greater part of their value directly or indirectly from immovable property situated in the other Contracting State, or
(b) an interest in a partnership or trust the assets of which consist principally of immovable property situated in the other Contracting State, or of shares referred to in sub paragraph (a) above, may be taxed in that other State.
(5) Gains from the alienation of any property other than that referred to in paragraphs (1), (2), (3) and (4) of this Article shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the alienator is a resident provided that those gains are subject to tax in that Contracting State.”
As mentioned in Section 2.1.1, gains from capital transfer by the transferor could be considered as not deriving their value directly or indirectly from immovable property situated in Vietnam, given that THE VIETNAMESE COMPANY’s assets mostly do not have immovable property. As such, gains from capital transfer by the transferor would be subject to Paragraph 5, Article 13, the Vietnam – UK DTA
Under Paragraph 5, gain from capital transfer of the transferor (a resident of the UK) under the Vietnam – the UK DTA shall be taxable only in the UK (i.e. tax exempted in Vietnam) if such gain is subject to tax in the UK.
From your confirmation, we understand that contemplated capital transfer in THE VIETNAMESE COMPANY of the transferor is not subject to tax in the UK. On such basis, tax exemption in Vietnam is not available to the transferor under Vietnam – the UK DTA.
Tax credit
According to Paragraph 1a, Article 22 (Elimination of Double Taxation), Vietnam – the UK DTA:
“(1) Subject to the provisions of the law of the United Kingdom regarding the allowance as a credit against United Kingdom tax of tax payable in a territory outside the United Kingdom (which shall not affect the general principle hereof):
Vietnamese tax payable under the laws of Vietnam and in accordance with this Agreement, whether directly or by deduction, on profits, income or chargeable gains from sources within Vietnam (excluding in the case of a dividend, tax payable in Vietnam in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against any United Kingdom tax computed by reference to the same profits, income or chargeable gains by reference to which the Vietnamese tax is computed;
(3) For the purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article, profits, income and capital gains owned by a resident of a Contracting State which may be taxed in the other Contracting State in accordance with this Agreement shall be deemed to arise from sources in that other Contracting State.”

Under the above provision, if the transferor is required to pay tax in Vietnam, such tax shall be allowed as a credit against any UK tax computed by reference to the same profits, income or chargeable gains by reference to which the Vietnamese tax is computed. However, as no UK tax is imposed on such capital gain, tax credit might not be available to the transferor. The transferor should further check with the UK’s domestic tax regulations in this regard. 
Administrative procedures for tax exemption under the DTA
The tax exemption under the DTA is not automatically applied and the tax exemption notification to the local tax authority will be required. 
Pursuant to the current Vietnamese tax regulations, in order to apply the tax exemption for the transferor under Vietnam – Singapore DTA, the transferor is required to submit a dossier to notify their eligibility for tax exemption under the DTA to the local tax department. A dossier comprises of: 
A notification of eligibility for tax exemption or reduction under an agreement, made according to Form No. 01/HTQT issued with Circular 156;
The original (or legalized true copy) of the Certificate of residence granted by the Singapore tax authority agency in the year preceding the year of notification of eligibility for tax exemption or reduction under the agreement, which has been consularly legalized;
Certified copy of the capital transfer agreement, certified by the taxpayer. in case the capital transfer agreement is made in a foreign language, its main contents (i.e. the transferor; the transferee; the point of transfer; transfer contents; rights and obligations of each party; contractual value; time, mode and currency used for payment, etc.) must be translated into Vietnamese;
Certified copy of Business License of THE VIETNAMESE COMPANY; and
Letter of authorization which authorizes its legal representative to carry out procedures for tax exemption notification. 
As we observed in practice, the DTA implementation in Vietnam is often subject to interpretations by the local tax authority which could result in further enquiries and additional documents required by the tax authorities.
The deadline for DTA notification is fifteen (15) days before the deadline for CAT declaration, i.e. 5 days before the capital transfer is approved by the competent licensing authorities (i.e. new Business License of THE VIETNAMESE COMPANY with new shareholder is granted). Given in practice, it is difficult to estimate the timing of the issuance of the new Business license, it is recommended that the DTA notification dossier to be submitted upon THE VIETNAMESE COMPANY submits the application to revise its Business License.
