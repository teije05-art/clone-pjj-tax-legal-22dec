Background
ABC Co., Ltd (“the Company”) was incorporated in Vietnam under the Enterprise Registration Certificate (“ERC”) No. xxx dated 28 May 2008 issued by the Business Registration Office of Vinh Phuc Department of Planning and Investment and licensed to carry out the project under Investment Registration Certificate (“IRC”) No. xxx dated 28 May 2008 issued by the Management Board of Vinh Phuc Industrial Zones (the “Original Investment Project” or “OIP”).
The OIP’s objectives include (a) manufacturing and selling automotive components and parts for automobiles and motorcycles, and (b) trading raw materials, machines and tools for manufacturing automotive components and parts for automobiles and motorcycles. 
Activity (a) is entitled to Corporate Income Tax (“CIT”) at the preferential rate of 15% in 12 years from the first year it operates (FY08), CIT exemption for 03 years from the first year it generates a taxable profit (FY09-11) and 50% CIT reduction for the 07 succeeding years (FY12-18). That said, no CIT incentive is available for OIP after FY18. 
The Company applied for the 5th amended IRC dated 1 August 2022 for the increase in the investment capital and the charter capital, changes in project’s objectives and increase in production capacity (the “Expansion Investment Project” or “EIP”).
The changes in the project’s objectives include (i) removal of “Trading automotive components and parts for automobiles and motorcycle; Trading raw materials for manufacturing automotive components and parts for automobiles and motorcycles”; and (ii) supplementation of “Exercising the right to import, export, wholesale distribution (without setting up the wholesale outlet), products include: indicators, license plate lights, 4-wheel ceiling lights”.
The increase in investment capital, charter capital and production capacity is summarised as follows:
Per the Company’s confirmation, the increased investment capital is for construction of a new factory (Factory 2), new machinery and technology for manufacturing components and parts for motorcycles. The budgeted value for the EIP is estimated at VND87,707,515,448 with detailed break-down below. In which, In which, the value of buildings and factory per the construction contract No 01/CC105 signed between the Company and the contractor dated 28 June 2022 is VND56,938,680,000.
Based on the above information, the increase in historical cost of fixed assets of the EIP as compared to that before expansion investment (e.g. the fixed asset value at year-end FY2021 is VND76,176,748,994) would likely be more than 20%.
On the above background, the Company is considering whether it can avail the possible CIT incentive applicable to the EIP under the current Vietnamese tax regulations.
Please let us know if any of the above information is not correct as it may materially impact our comments hereunder.
Our comments
Possible CIT incentive for the Company’s EIP
Overview of the CIT regulations
Under the current CIT regulations, it is stipulated that:
An EIP is defined as investment project that further develops the current ongoing project, including expanding the production scale, increasing production capacity, innovating production technology. 
An EIP which is executed in the business sector or location entitled to CIT incentives under Decree 218/2013/ND-CP (including economic zones, hi-tech zones, industrial parks other than those located in urban districts of special-grade cities, centrally run grade-I cities and grade-I provincial cities), if satisfying one (01) of the three (03) following conditions:   
Historical cost of fixed assets increases by at least VND20 billion for an EIP operated in encouraged sectors or VND10 billion for an EIP operated in geographical areas with difficult or highly difficult socio-economic conditions.
Historical cost of fixed assets increases by at least 20% in comparison with total historical cost of fixed assets before investment.
Production capacity upon expansion investment increases by at least 20% in comparison with production capacity per technical design of initial investment.
can choose to either:
apply CIT incentives granted for the OIP for the remaining period; or
apply CIT exemption/ deduction (without preferential CIT rate) applicable to a new investment project of the same sector or location.
Analyses on the Company’s EIP
Pertaining to the Company’s EIP, on the basis that: 
The Company’s EIP is supported with the 5th amended IRC dated 1 August 2022 with the increase in investment capital, charter capital and production capacity;
The Company’s EIP is implemented in Binh Xuyen Industrial Zone (Binh Xuyen District, Vinh Phuc Province) which does not fall under the list of industrial zones located in urban districts of special-grade cities, centrally run grade-I cities and industrial zones located in grade-I provincial cities; and
The Company’s EIP satisfies condition (ii) whereby its historical cost of fixed asset is estimated to be increased higher than 20% and condition (iii) whereby its production capacity per the IRC will be higher than 20%,
it is likely that the Company’s EIP qualifies to choose to apply CIT incentive which is same as a new investment project in the same location, particularly two (02) years of CIT exemption from the first year that EIP generates taxable income; and four (04) subsequent years of 50% CIT reduction (no preferential CIT rate will be available). 

Conditions and requirements for CIT incentive entitlement
For CIT incentive entitlement, per our observation from private rulings of the local tax authorities and the tax audit practice, the EIP is required to be supported with an amended IRC with an increase in investment capital, production scale, etc. 
As a prerequisite to enjoy CIT incentive for the EIP, the Company must apply Vietnamese Accounting Standard regime, maintain invoices and supporting documents as required under Vietnamese accounting regulations.
The CIT exemption/ reduction period will start from the first year of the EIP’s having taxable profit. Where the EIP does not generate any taxable profits in three (03) consecutive years from the first year of generating revenue, the CIT exemption will start in the fourth year despite the fact that no taxable profit has been made.
If for the first tax year, the EIP has the period of CIT incentive business activity shorter than twelve (12) months, the Company may choose to apply CIT incentive from that first tax year or register with the tax authority to apply CIT incentive from the following tax year. If the Company registers to apply CIT incentive from the following tax year, they will need to declare and pay CIT at the standard CIT rate for the first tax year.
The additional income from expansion investment eligible for CIT incentives must be separately recorded. In case the Company cannot record the additional income of the EIP separately, the additional income of the EIP will be determined based on the “fixed asset ratio” (i.e. Historical cost of fixed assets newly put into production and business from the EIP/ Total historical cost of fixed assets of the Company).
As a related issue, we would note that:
For calculation of “fixed asset ratio”, the tax authority may request to take into account the actual number of months in the year that such additional fixed assets from the EIP are put into use, rather than the full-year basis, which may lower the fixed asset ratio and subsequently, lower the EIP’s income eligible for CIT incentive.
The tax authority tends to insist on applying the calculation method which results in higher CIT liabilities. Pertaining to the Company’s case, since the additional fixed assets from the EIP is expected to account for the majority of the Company’s total historical costs of fixed assets which will potentially result in lower total CIT liabilities, the tax authority may strictly request the Company to separately record the additional income of the EIP, rather than using “fixed asset ratio” allocation, for CIT purposes. 
Where possible and in order to avoid such potential challenge, the Company is recommended to arrange for separate record of revenue and expenses for the EIP. Those overhead expenses which cannot be separately accounted might be allocated using the revenue ratio. 
On the understanding that the total increased investment capital under the Company’s 5th amended IRC is for “manufacturing activity”, not for “trading activity”, the related CIT incentives would be technically applied on the income from the manufacturing activity only. Thus, separation of income from different business activities is required for CIT calculation purposes.
The application of CIT incentives is based on the Company’s self-assessment basis. However, for prudent purpose, the Company is recommended to seek a written confirmation from the local tax authority to serve as a basis for implementation and to avoid unnecessary tax administrative penalty (e.g. recollection of CIT liabilities, 20% penalty of the under-paid CIT liabilities and late payment interest at 0,03%/day) by the tax authority in the future tax audit.
Important Note

You will appreciate that the laws are frequently being changed, both prospectively and retrospectively. A number of key reform measures have been implemented, a number of other key reforms have been deferred and the status of some key reforms remains unclear at this stage.
Unless special arrangements are made, our advice provided will not be updated to take account of subsequent changes to the tax legislation, case law, rulings and determinations issued by the Vietnamese tax governing bodies or other practices of taxation authorities. It is your responsibility to seek further advice or updates, if you are to rely on our advice at a later date.
