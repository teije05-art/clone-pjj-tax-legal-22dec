Dear XXX,

As requested, we would like to set out below our comments on relevant Vietnam tax implications in relation to ABC’s contemplated share subscription at premium for your information and consideration.

Background

ABC has planned to acquire 49% stake in two existing one-member limited liability companies (“XY1 and XY2”) specializing in warehousing business, currently wholly owned by XYZ in Vietnam.

For certain commercial reasons, we understand that it was intended for XY1 and XY2 to be converted into Joint-Stock Companies (“JSC”). However, due to the impact of Covid and the need to hasten the timeline for the deal, it is now contemplated that a restructuring will take place such that 2 new JSCs, JVCo 1 and JV Co2 will be set up to hold XY1 and XY2 respectively.

Based on the information provided, we understand that the restructuring steps are as follow:

XYZ, via VC3, will subscribe for new shares in JVCo 1 / 2 at a premium, at a total of USD 7.2 million which represents a 99.8% stake in JV Co 1 / 2. VC3 will have 2 wholly owned SPVs that will own nominal (0.1%) stake in JV Co 1 / 2.
VC3 will then provide shareholder loans of USD 22.5 million to JV Co 1 / 2.
JV Co 1 / 2 will use the total proceeds of USD 29.7 million to acquire 100% shares in TH 1 / 2
ABC will then subscribe to new shares of JV Co 1 / 2 for a total consideration of USD 22.5 million (comprising USD 1 million of chartered capital and USD 21.5 million of share premium). JV Co 1 / 2 will use the proceeds received to repay the USD 22.5 million shareholder loan to VC 3.

We understand that the reason for having a large share premium is to keep the charter capital of JVCo1 and JVCo2 low and facilitate repatriation of dividends from the premium (i.e., dividends may be declared out of the share premium).

The contemplated structure is illustrated as follows (as provided by XYZ):

XXX

In this regard, we are requested to provide our comments on Vietnam tax implications applicable to the contemplated share subscription at premium by ABC 1 and ABC 2.

Executive summary

Based on available guidance, it is not clear to conclude that the premium in accordance with the share subscription by ABC1 and ABC2 for 49% interest in JVCo1 and JVCo2 will not be taxed in hands of JVCo1 and JVCo2. That being said, we are of the view that the practical risk is low.

Upon future divestment of ABC1 and ABC2 from JVCo1 and JVCo2, there exists a technical risk that the premium may not be allowed to be treated as capital cost for CAT calculation purpose given the lack of clear regulations and guiding rulings. Nonetheless, in practice, based on our verbal check with some local tax authorities, our audit colleagues, and also the limited precedent cases, the risk of the premium being disallowed should be considered low. 

Notwithstanding the above, if absolute certainty on the above position is required, ABC1 and ABC 2 could consider seeking a ruling from the local tax authority. However, given the time constraints and the low risk, we understand that this is not commercially preferred.

Alternatively, ABC can also consider obtaining indemnities from XYZ with regards to the potential tax exposures highlighted above, where commercially feasible.

Separately, per our discussions with our audit and legal colleagues, we understand that the current regulations do not allow dividends to be declared out of the share premium. In addition, where the reason for the share premium is to facilitate an ease of repatriation of cash to investors, we understand any repayment of cash to investors via reduction of share premium should also be considered as a capital reduction exercise, which takes a long time (similar to the process of capital reduction of chartered capital).


Our detailed comments

Please note that our comments in the following sections are only applicable to ABC1 and ABC2 with respect to their contemplated share subscription at premium, and do not cover the previous restructuring exercises by XYZ.

Vietnam tax regulations relevant to share subscription at premium

According to Point 3, Article 5 of Circular 96 (amending Circular 78 on CIT):

“In case the enterprise lawfully admits a new capital contributor which contributes cash more than the value of its capital contribution in the total charter capital of the enterprise, it shall be handled as follows:

If such positive difference is determined as belonging to the enterprise, used to supplement the enterprise’s working capital, it will not be taxable when calculating corporate income tax of the receiving enterprise.

If such positive difference is divided among existing capital contributors, it will be considered as income of existing capital contributors.”

In addition, according to Article 8 of Circular 96 (amending Circular 78 on CIT):

“The historical cost of the transferred capital is determined on a case-by-case basis as follows:

In the case of transferring capital previously contributed to establish the enterprise, the historical cost is the actual capital amount which has been cumulatively contributed by the capital assignor (the investor) as at the assignment date. This original value of the assigned capital must be supported by and based on accounting books, invoices and vouchers; in addition, it must be certified by investors or participants in the business cooperation contract, or according to audit results provided by an independent audit company if the enterprise is a 100% Foreign Invested Enterprise.

In the case of assigning the capital previously acquired from other investors, the initial value of the assigned capital is the value of the capital at the time of the historical purchase. Such purchasing price can be determined based on the capital assignment contract, and relevant payment vouchers.”

Of note, regarding the underlined part above, it is unclear whether the audited financial statements (“FS”) can also be used if the enterprise is not 100% foreign invested (which is the case of JVCo1 and JVCo2). Nevertheless, in practice, the audited FS is normally used in this case together with the payment evidences of capital contribution, and we have not seen any challenge from local tax authorities on such arrangement.

Potential Vietnam tax implications for ABC1 and ABC2 with respect to their contemplated share subscription at premium

We understand that, the premium would be determined as belonging to JVCo1 and JVCo2, but the premium would not be used to supplement the working capitals of JVCo1 and JVCo2 (i.e., it would be used to repay the shareholder loans to VC3).

Accordingly, in line with Point 3, Article 5 of Circular 96 as noted above, it is not crystal clear for a conclusion that such premium will not be taxed in hands of JVCo1 and JVCo2. So, we recommend ABC1 and ABC2 to seek a ruling from the local tax authority in advance.

In addition, given this is an abnormal arrangement with such huge premium, the tax authorities may review the entire restructuring exercises (including the previous restructuring exercises by XYZ); and if there is any additional tax exposure imposed on JVCo1 and JVCo2, then ABC1 and ABC2 as the shareholders will also be impacted.

Upon future divestment of ABC1 and ABC2 from JVCo1 and JVCo2 (which we assume are non-public joint stock companies at that time), where ABC1 and ABC 2 will be subject to 20% CAT in Vietnam on the gain (which is calculated as transfer price minus capital cost), there is a risk that the capital cost may be challenged by the Vietnam tax authorities.

Specifically, based on the information stated in the background information above, the capital cost of ABC1 and ABC2 in JVCo1 and JVCo2 is at USD22.5 million, comprising two components:

The amount which ABC1 and ABC2 contributed to JVCo1 and JVCo2 and recorded as charter capital: USD1 million.

The premium amount which ABC1 and ABC2 contributed to JVCo1 and JVCo2 and recorded as share/ capital premium: USD21.5 million.

Accordingly, (a) should be treated as the cost base for Vietnam CAT purposes provided that the supporting documents are in place (i.e., accounting records, bank transfer vouchers, audited FS, etc.).

With respect to whether (b) should also be included in the cost base for Vietnam CAT purposes:

The mainstream tax regulations are unclear on this case. According to Article 8 of Circular 96 (as noted above), for the case of transferring capital previously contributed, the capital cost is only defined as “actual capital amount which has been cumulatively contributed”, “supported by and based on accounting books, invoices and vouchers”, and “according to audit results”.

Given the huge premium in this case, it is very likely to attract attention and questions from the tax authorities as to the reason why JVCo1 and JVCo2 would have such huge premium and low charter capital, and consequently they may scrutinise whether such huge premium would be included in the cost base for future divestment by ABC1 and ABC2.

Based on our research of available rulings, there was no ruling which precisely addressed the premium in this case (i.e., new investor contributes such huge premium, then the same investor divests in the future).

Based on Official Letter 53581/CT-TTHT dated 8 July 2019 of Hanoi Tax Department, in case a local investee company distributes share premium to a local investor in form of ordinary shares (with an equivalent amount), then the capital cost when the local investor disposes such shares would not include such premium.

Based on another private ruling which was not made public issued by Ho Chi Minh City Tax Department dated 29 January 2021, Investor 1 (Singapore) invested in Investee (Vietnam) with premium. The premium was shared to Investor 2 (BVI), and Investor 2 duly paid tax in Vietnam. Subsequently, Investor 2 contributed such money back into capital contribution in the Investee. The ruling stated that the capital cost when Investor 2 disposes its investment would include such premium value.

In line with the above rulings, there were different conclusions on whether the capital cost includes the premium or not, depending on the nature of the specific cases. Note that, the cases mentioned in these rulings do not match our specific case however.

We have checked with some local tax authorities on a no-name basis on this specific case (i.e., new investor contributes premium, then the same investor divests in the future). 

Based on our verbal discussions with Dong Nai Province Tax Department and especially Binh Duong Province Tax Department (i.e., the tax office managing JVCo1 and JVCo2), they shared the view that, if the audit results (i.e., audited FS) of JVCo1 and JVCo2 show the premium as a part of the capital cost of ABC1 and ABC2, then such premium should be included into the capital cost of ABC1 and ABC2 for CAT calculation purposes.

Further, based on our verbal discussions with Hanoi City Tax Department and Ho Chi Minh City Tax Department, they also shared the same view that the premium should be included into the capital cost for CAT calculation purposes, but their statements were not as clear as Dong Nai Province Tax Department and Binh Duong Province Tax Department’s.

Of note, per our discussion with our audit colleagues, the accounting books and audited FS of JVCo1 and JVCo2 should present the capital actually contributed by ABC1 and ABC2 as “Share capital” and “Share premium” which form “Owner’s equity”.

Accordingly, in line with comments from our audit colleagues and views of the local tax authorities, if the accounting books and audited FS of JVCo1 and JVCo2 present the capital actually contributed by ABC1 and ABC2 as “Share capital” and “Share premium” which form “Owner’s equity”, it could be interpreted that the premium should be included into the capital cost of ABC1 and ABC2 for CAT calculation purposes in the future.

Nevertheless, given the potential tax exposure in the future is huge, we recommend ABC1 and ABC2 to seek ruling from the local tax authority in advance before proceeding with this proposed arrangement.

Comment on the validity of the benefit of share premium

We understand that the reason for the high premium arrangement is to keep the charter capital of JVCo1 and JVCo2 low, and to facilitate repatriation of dividends from the premium (i.e., dividends may be declared out of the share premium). However, per our discussions with our audit and legal colleagues, the current regulations on accounting and enterprise do not allow payment of dividend from the share premium.

Please note that, even if it is possible to pay dividend from the share premium, then logically the premium recorded in the books of JVCo1 and JVCo2 will decrease, and hence ABC1 and ABC2 cannot claim such premium as capital cost upon future divestment.

In addition, based on our understanding, any repayment of cash to investors out of the share premium is also considered a capital reduction exercise, which is a time consuming process, similar to the process for repaying cash to investors out of chartered capital.
