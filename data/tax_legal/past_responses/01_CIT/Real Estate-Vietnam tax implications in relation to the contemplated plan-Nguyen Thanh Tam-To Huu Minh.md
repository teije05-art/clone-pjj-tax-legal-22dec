Dear Sirs,

With reference to the signed Inter-Firm Agreement dated …, we would like to set out below our comments on the associated Vietnamese tax implications in relation to the Contemplated Plan of XYZ (the “Company”), for your consideration.

Background

A is a Japan incorporated company. B is a limited partnership in Japan. A and B will establish a 50/50 joint venture in Japan named J-SPC.

C is a Vietnam incorporated company specifying in real estate business.

A, B and C are considering an investment whereby: 

C shall establish JVC, a limited liability company wholly owned by C, which is functioned/ specified to real estate projects involving building detached houses for sale (the “Project”). 

C shall subsequently transfer its 80% of capital contribution in JVC to J-SPC.  After the transaction, J-SPC and C will hold 80% and 20% of the charter capital of JVC, respectively. The structure is illustrated as the below chart.

We understand that C will obtain the Project land and required licenses for development of the Project, then will transfer them to JVC.  


The above-said investment is currently in the planning stage and there has not been any execution until now.

A is currently intended that, when JVC completing the sale of houses of the Project, J-SPC will have the exit option as the following steps (the “Contemplated Plan”):

Step 1: To implement the capital reduction plan by applying to the licensing authority to reduce its registered contributed capital (i.e., reduction of J-SPC’s shareholding in JVC and the chartered capital in JVC will be decreased corresponding to such reduction).

Step 2: To liquidate the JVC.

In this regard, the Company is seeking KPMG’s advice on the Vietnamese tax implications in association with the proposed capital reduction and the JVC liquidation arrangements. 

Our comments

Our comments on Vietnam tax implications are based on the understanding that the Contemplated Plan as provided have been discussed with the legal advisor to be feasible and doable from a legal perspective.

Step 1: To implement the capital reduction plan

Reduction of charter capital is subject to the approval of the Vietnam licensing authorities. Although it is legally allowed under the law, in practice, reduction of charter capital could be challenged and questioned by the licensing authorities in most cases. Specifically, in case JVC has accumulated loss as at the date of applying capital reduction, there is a possibility that the tax authority would not accept that given they may concern about the capacity of JVC to pay debts and financial obligations post capital-reduction exercise. 

Having said that, we have observed several cases including enterprises having real estate business, in which the capital reductions were approved by the licensing authorities.

From a tax perspective, capital reduction should not be a taxable event in Vietnam. 

Step 2: Liquidate the JVC

In Vietnam, the dissolution of a company is complicated and time consuming as the company is required to clear all of its outstanding liabilities and obligations. Although the statutory timeline for company dissolution is approximately six (6) months, in practice, it normally takes years (from 1 to 3 years on average) to complete all the procedures. The actual timing depends on the scale of the company and its status of compliance with the laws during its operation. The dissolution generally includes the following steps:

Passing a decision on dissolution.

Terminating the operation of the dependent unit(s) (if any); and settling all of outstanding liabilities and obligations with the relevant parties in the following order:

Employment income, severance allowances and social insurance in accordance with law and other benefits of employees;
Tax liabilities; and
Other debts/ obligations (i.e., suppliers, customers, landlord, creditors).
 
Submitting a request for company dissolution to the licensing authority.

From a Vietnam tax perspective, JVC should note the followings when liquidation:

Liquidating JVC’s assets

In case of sale/transfer of the assets, JVC is required to declare and pay Value Added Tax (“VAT”) (at the rate of from 5% or 10% depending on the type of assets sold/transferred) and Corporate Income Tax (“CIT”) (at the standard rate of 20%) on the revenue/taxable income generated from the sale/transfer of assets (if any) in accordance with the prevailing laws.

Fulfilling tax liabilities and deactivating JVC’s tax code

JVC is required to conduct the following procedure to deactivate the company’s tax code for the purpose of terminating its operations:

Notification on the deactivation of the tax code: JVC shall submit to the tax authority a dossier for deactivation of its tax code which comprises document requesting deactivation of tax code and a copy of the dissolution resolution.

Within two (2) working days from receipt of required documents for the dissolution of the Company, the tax authority shall issue a written Notification acknowledging that the Company has ceased its operations and is conducting the procedure for deactivating its tax code.

Finalisation of tax liabilities: JVC is required to finalise its tax liabilities as of the date passing the dissolution resolution as follows:

Preparing and submitting the CIT finalisation return

JVC shall submit CIT finalisation for its last fiscal period to the local tax authority within forty-five (45) days from its dissolution date. 

It is worth noting that any expenses incurred after the dissolution date will likely be considered as non-deductible expenses for CIT purposes. Accordingly, it is advised that JVC should have already incurred all necessary expenses and obtain supporting documents (i.e., invoices, payment documents) before the dissolution date. In case there are expenses that must be accrued at the dissolution date, JVC should maintain documents to justify that those expenses are related to its business activities and/ or dissolution activities and so deductible for CIT purposes.

Preparing and submitting the PIT finalisation return

JVC shall submit PIT finalisation for its employees for the last calendar year within forty-five (45) days from dissolution date.

Preparing and submitting the VAT declaration returns

JVC shall submit its VAT declaration returns to the local tax authority till the last periods of its operation. 

Same as CIT matters as aforementioned, JVC should make all supporting documents related to its input VAT available before the dissolution date to avoid risk of input VAT being treated non-creditable.

Preparing and submitting FCT declaration returns 

JVC shall continue to submit its FCT declarations to the local tax authority until the last months of its operation or the last overseas remittance which is subject to FCT.

Tax audit: When receiving of the sufficient tax finalisation dossiers from JVC, the tax authority is responsible to carry out the procedure for tax audit at the JVC’s premises for the purpose of dissolution of JVC and deactivation of the tax code of JVC. In practice, the actual timing for tax audit depends on the working schedule of the local tax authority and delay is always anticipated in this procedure.

Please note that, generally, the tax clearance for company dissolution is an onerous, troublesome, and time-consuming exercise.

Upon the termination, on the assumption that there is not any special arrangement/ agreement related to the JVC and/ or between J-SPC’s shareholders and C, JVC can repatriate the remain assets to J-SPC and C without being subject to any further tax.


Our recommendations

As noted above, the capital reduction could normally be challenged and questioned by the licensing authorities, and the tax clearance for company dissolution is normally an onerous, troublesome, and time-consuming exercise. Accordingly, A and B may consider the below approaches:

Approach 1: J-SPC shall transfer its shares in JVC to C

Under this approach, after completing the sale of houses of the Project, JVC shall distribute the after-tax profits/dividends to J-SPC and C. The remaining assets of the JVC should only include miscellaneous assets.

After that, J-SPC shall transfer its shares in JVC to C. It is expected that the share transfer price would be at cost or at a small gain (as all of the after-tax profits/dividends have been transferred to J-SPC and C).

If there is a gain, such gain would be subject to Capital Assignment Tax (“CAT”) at the rate of 20%. Please refer to Appendix 1 for more information on Vietnam CAT. 

The transfer of capital in JVC by J-SPC is not subject to VAT and registration fee in Vietnam.

This approach should save a lot of time compared to the original approach (related to capital reduction and company liquidation), i.e., this approach may take 1 – 2 months, while the original approach may take 1 – 3 years practically.

Please note that, this approach should be discussed and agreed in advance with C.

Approach 2: Directly conduct the liquidation of JVC (without capital reduction)

In case Approach 1 does not work by any reason, after completing the sale of houses of the Project, JVC shall continue transferring all its remaining assets. Gains from transferring such remaining assets should also be distributed to J-SPC and C (in form of the after-tax profits/dividends); this could help J-SPC and C in term of cash flow in comparison with the original approach.

In addition, JVC should settle other liabilities and obligations with the relevant parties in advance (e.g., labour contract, other financial obligations from suppliers, customers, landlord, creditors, etc.).

Afterward, JVC shall start the liquidation procedure. Please see our comments in point 2.2 above for further information. This approach should be simpler and save more time than the original approach. 

Interpretation of future change in laws

We have been requested to advise on the Vietnamese tax and regulatory consequences associated with the above arrangements only. Our advice therefore focuses on current laws and regulations within the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and will not consider issues belonging to other tax jurisdictions.

The advice has been prepared based on the documents and information supplied by the Company and the current laws and regulations, which are issued by the competent authorities of Vietnam, as at the date of the advice. Where regulations are quoted in English in this advice, the quotation may be from a KPMG unofficial translation of the source document and not an official translation. You will appreciate that the tax law is frequently being changed, both prospectively and retrospectively. A number of key tax reform measures have been implemented, a number of other key reforms have been deferred and the status of some key reforms remains unclear at this stage.

Unless special arrangements are made, our advice provided will not be updated to take account of subsequent changes to the tax legislation, case law, rulings and determinations issued by the Vietnamese tax governing bodies or other practices of taxation authorities. It is your responsibility to seek further advice or updates, if you are to rely on our advice at a later date.

We are, of course, unable to give any guarantee that our interpretation will ultimately be sustained in the event of challenge by the Vietnamese tax authorities. Our above advice is for the Company's use only and may not be distributed to, or relied on, by any other party.

We trust the above is helpful for your purposes. Please do not hesitate to contact us know should you need further clarification.

Yours sincerely,

APPENDIX 1: VIETNAM CAT REGULATIONS

CAT implications

Selling an interest by a foreign investor in a company established under Vietnam Enterprise Law and/or Investment Law to another investor (i.e., capital assignee) in Vietnam is deemed as a direct investment transfer and subject to Circular 78 and Circular 96. In this regard, the capital assignor who earns income (or technically should be known as making gains) from assignment of capital is subject to a Corporate Income Tax (“CIT”) rate of 20% on any gain derived from the capital assignment. This tax on capital assignment is generally referred to as CAT.

In the case where the assignor does not receive a cash consideration but by way of other assets or in-kind benefits (i.e., stocks, fund certificates, etc.) and makes a gain, such gain is subject to CAT. The value of the assets, stocks, fund certificates, etc. are based on market price of such assets at the time of receipt by the capital assignor.

According to Circular 78 and Circular 96, the taxable income for CAT purposes is determined as follows:

Taxable income = Assigned Value – Initial Value of the assigned capital – Assignment Expenses

(Please note that the above formula is applicable in the case the Assigned Value is gross of tax. Where the price is agreed to be net of tax, the net assigned value is required to be grossed up for CAT calculation purposes)

Of which:

Assigned Value is the total actual value which the assignor will receive under the capital assignment contract. Where the assignment contract does not specify the value, or where the tax office has a basis for determining that the price was not determined on an arm's-length basis, the tax authority shall have the right to examine and determine the value of the consideration of the contract on the basis of market prices or available selling prices to third parties or on similar assignment contracts.

In the case where the transfer price fixed by the tax authorities is inappropriate, it shall be based on the valuation/ appraisal by a competent professional valuation organisation at the time of the transfer.

Initial Value of the assigned capital is the actual capital amount which has been accumulatively contributed by the capital assignor (the investor) as at the assignment date. This original value of the assigned capital must be supported by and based on accounting books, invoices and vouchers; in addition, it must be certified by investors or participants in the business cooperation contract (or according to audit results provided by an independent audit company if the enterprise is a FIE.

In case of assigning the capital previously acquired from other investors, the initial value of the assigned capital is the value of the capital at the time of the historical purchase. Such purchasing price can be determined based on the capital assignment contract, and relevant payment vouchers.

Assignment Expenses shall be the actual expenses directly related to assignment activities supported by legitimate invoices, documents. Where such assignment expenses are incurred overseas, supporting originals documents/invoices must be legalized, certified by the competent authorities or auditing firm of the country where expenses were incurred and translated into Vietnamese with the confirmation from the legal representative.

Assignment expenses include expenses for carrying out legal procedures necessary for the transfer; charges and fees paid for carrying out transfer procedures; expenses for transaction, negotiation and signing of the transfer contract; and other expenses with evidencing documents.

CAT compliance procedures

Under the current regulations, CAT return is required to be filed to the local tax authorities as follows: 

If capital assignor is a Vietnamese organisation, the Vietnamese capital assignor must account the income as its other income and include in taxable income for CIT purposes;

If the capital assignor is a foreign organisation, the Vietnamese capital assignee is responsible for CAT filing/ payment to the tax authority on behalf of the foreign organisation; 

If the capital assignor and assignee are both foreign organisations, the enterprise set up under Vietnamese laws in which foreign organisations invest capital shall declare and pay the CAT liability on behalf of the foreign organisations.
