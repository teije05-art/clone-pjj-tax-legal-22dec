Capital gain tax
Capital assignment profit tax (“CAPT”) represents Vietnam’s taxation of capital gains realized from the alienation of property.
Income derived from a direct or indirect capital assignment in Vietnam is subject to CAPT without reference to where the sales transaction was executed.
Transfer price should be evidenced by a sale and purchase agreement.  The cost base comprises acquisition cost and transaction expenses.  Acquisition cost is broadly the value of transferor’s contributed capital as at the time of contribution.
Transaction expenses (arguably those incurred by the transferor) typically include legal and professional expenses, levies, communication expenses, negotiations, etc.
Under current regulations, both direct and indirect transfer of capital or interest related to assets/companies in Vietnam are subject to CAPT.

The tax authorities now pay much attention to indirect capital transfer transactions and will impose taxes on offshore transactions if it comes to their attention. The awareness of the tax authorities on the offshore transactions depends on the publicity of the related information (e.g. name change of the SPV, newspaper, transfer pricing declaration, etc.).
The CAPT rates are as follows:
