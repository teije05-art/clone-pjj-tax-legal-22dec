Background information
You hold German nationality. However, you have not been living in Germany for several years.
From 2017 to 2020, you were living in Austria and travelling back and forth between Austria and Vietnam. The time you spent in Vietnam in this period was four to six months per each calendar year.
In 2021, you travelled to Vietnam in January and have been here since then. You married to a Vietnamese citizen and have been holding a Temporary Resident Card (“TRC”) in Vietnam from 2021 onwards.
During the period from 2017 to 2020, you earned income from playing poker and cryptocurrency trading. In 2021 you realized significant gains on cryptocurrency. No tax declaration and payments have been made to date on such income.
At this stage, you are seeking KPMG’s advice on the Vietnamese tax implications on your income from cryptocurrency trading for your tax compliance and planning purposes.

Executive summary
Vietnam has not recognized cryptocurrency as a legal currency.  Using cryptocurrency as a means of payment is prohibited, while owning and trading cryptocurrency is not protected by law.
There has been no legal framework established for cryptocurrency related activities, including a general framework to explicitly recognize cryptocurrency as an asset and taxation framework for taxing income earned from cryptocurrency trading.  Currently, taxation of cryptocurrency trading activities is subject to different interpretation among competent authorities, including classification of income type subject to PIT, taxability/non-taxability treatment, income base for tax calculation and relevant tax rates. 
In practice, there was a typical case where tax authorities have tried to impose tax on income from cryptocurrency trading activities but this was then rejected by tribunal when the case was brought to court.  The reason for rejection was due to the lack of any specific legal framework on this subject.
The Government and competent authorities are in progress to establish and complete a legal framework for cryptocurrency and relevant taxation method.  In the meantime, individuals having cryptocurrency trading activities should be aware that currently there is a low risk of being challenged by tax authorities, and the outcome of the challenge to date has not resulted in any tax liability being determined,
Therefore, under current practice in Vietnam gains/income arising from the trade of cryptocurrency have not been subject to tax.  However, this practice is likely to change in the future as a legal framework for the recognition of cryptocurrency is established.   It should be noted that the introduction of new law is not generally applied retrospectively in Vietnam.  As such, under current practice, the gains/income crystalised to date should not be subject to tax in Vietnam.  
Our detailed analysis
General regulation framework
In Vietnam, cryptocurrency is not recognized as a legal currency.  The Government and the competent authorities (SBV, the Prime Minister, the State Bank Governor) have issued a number of Decree, Decisions, Directives, OLs and Press Release on this matter, which express that issuing, providing and using cryptocurrency as a means of payment is prohibited and would be subject to penalty, whilst owning or trading of cryptocurrency is not protected by law.
Apart from the above documents, cryptocurrency is not specifically mentioned in any principal laws and regulations. The questions are whether cryptocurrency can be considered as a kind of asset that can be traded, and whether trading of cryptocurrency, though not protected by law, is prohibited or not as there are no explicit regulations on such a prohibition. 
As not specifically regulated under any principal law and regulations, we need to consider the underlying laws and regulations such as the Civil Code, Commercial Law and the Constitution. Specifically:
According to the Civil Code, the definition of asset encompasses objects, money, valuable papers and property rights. An asset includes immovable properties (e.g real estate) and movable properties.  Property rights are the rights which can be valued in money, including property rights the subject of intellectual property rights, right to use land and other property rights.  Movable properties are properties which are not immovable property.
Based on the Commercial Law, goods include all types of movable property, including those to be formed in the future and those attached to land.
According to the Constitution, everyone has the right to freedom of enterprise in the sectors and trades that are not prohibited by law.
In line with the above general regulations, cryptocurrency might be interpreted as a kind of movable property, in particular it might be regarded as property rights in accordance with the Civil Code and can be traded according to the Constitution and the Commercial Law, as there are no explicit prohibition on such trading activity. This interpretation was adopted by tax authorities for tax purpose. However, this interpretation may not be accepted by other competent authorities due to the lack of specific regulations on this matter.
Tax regulations 
From a tax perspective, cryptocurrency related income is not specifically mentioned in any tax regulations.  As a general rule, the Law on Tax Administration No. 38/2019/QH14 states as follows: 
“Regulations of tax liabilities determined by nature of activities and transactions” means regulations implemented in tax administration to analyze business transactions and activities of taxpayers so as to determine tax liabilities corresponding to values generated by the nature of those business transactions and activities.”
As analyzed above, though not explicitly regulated under any principal law and regulations, cryptocurrency might be considered as a kind of asset in nature and trading of cryptocurrency might be regarded as a trading activity that is not prohibited by law. Accordingly, it should be subject to tax in accordance with the general rule on tax administration.
Where the trading activity is performed by individuals and income is generated, the PIT regulations should be applied. Under current PIT regulations, personal income taxpayers include (i) tax residents who earn taxable income worldwide and (ii) tax non-residents who earn taxable income sourced from Vietnam. The income subject to PIT includes income from business activities and income from capital transfer.
According to Circular 111 on PIT, income from business activities is defined as income from production and sale of goods and services that belong to all industries such as production, goods sale, construction, transportation, restaurants, service provision including lease of houses, right to use land, water surface, and other property.  Meanwhile, income from capital transfer includes income from securities transfer.
Though the current PIT regulations do not have any specific provision on income from cryptocurrency trading, income from this activity may either be considered as income from business activities or income from capital transfer based on its nature. It is more likely to be considered as income from business activities as cryptocurrency is currently not recognized as a kind of security in accordance with the Law on Securities. Public entities, security companies, fund management companies, security investment funds are not allowed to perform issuance activities or undertake transactions related to illegal cryptocurrency as guided in a ruling issued by the State Securities Commission of Vietnam. However, this might be subject to change in future.
Where income from cryptocurrency trading is considered as income from business activities, the tax rates applicable for tax residents would be 1% VAT and 0.5% PIT for goods trading activities, or 2% VAT and 1% PIT for other business activities not specifically named in the business sector list. For tax non-residents, the tax rates would be 1% PIT for goods trading activities, or 2% PIT for other business activities not specifically named in the business sector list. Where income from cryptocurrency trading is considered as income from capital transfer, the applicable tax rate would be 0.1% of the total proceeds regardless of tax residency status of the individuals.
Regarding tax resident status, an individual shall be treated as a tax resident for Vietnamese tax purposes if he/she meets one of the following conditions:
Staying in Vietnam for 183 days or more in a tax year (twelve-month period from his/her first arrival to Vietnam, or calendar year); or
Staying in Vietnam for less than 183 days in a tax year but having a permanent residential place in Vietnam for 183 days or more (including a rented house, hotel, guest house, or holding a TRC), while not be able to prove that he/she is a tax resident of another country.
If the above conditions are not met, an individual shall be considered as a tax non-resident for Vietnamese PIT purpose.   
It is also important to note that cryptocurrency trading is normally anonymous and performed via international virtual currency exchange, which causes difficulty to determine the taxable income base. As regulated under the Law on Tax Administration, a deemed income method could be applied if the taxpayer fails to present the supporting documents relevant to the determination of tax payable within a certain time limit as requested by tax authorities.  
Interpretation of tax authorities and practical cases
Though not specifically referred to in the tax regulations, in practice, a local tax authority has imposed tax and penalties on income from cryptocurrency trading of an individual who had not declared and paid relevant taxes.  The decision of the local tax authority was supported by OL No. 4356/BTC-TCT of the MOF, which opines that cryptocurrency is a kind of asset and cryptocurrency trading is not prohibited by law.  Therefore, the individual having cryptocurrency trading activities is subject to PIT declaration and payment in accordance with relevant tax regulations.
Notwithstanding the above, when the case was brought to court, the decision of the local tax authority and OL No. 4356 of the MOF were rejected due to the lack of a principal law and regulations which explicitly acknowledge that cryptocurrency is a kind of asset.  On that basis, the individual was released from tax retroactive collection and penalty payment.
Given the above, there exists different interpretations among the competent authorities on the taxation of income from cryptocurrency trading.  From the tax authority’s view, they consider that cryptocurrency is an asset that can be traded and therefore any income/gain should be subject to tax under general taxation principles.  However, as there is no solid legal framework on cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency trading, such interpretation might be challenged by judicial authorities as in the above mentioned case.  Notwithstanding this, it is acknowledged that generally taxpayers would prefer not to bring their cases to court as it is complicated, time consuming and the outcome is not guaranteed, especially in this situation where regulations are ambiguous and interpretation may vary from time to time and among different authorities. 
Development roadmap for cryptocurrency related legal framework 
Similar to many countries, Vietnam has not recognized cryptocurrency as a legal currency and has not established a legal framework for cryptocurrency related activities. Notwithstanding this, the Government has started to acknowledge the development of virtual currencies in the globalization era and has considered working plans to address this issue. In particular:
On 21 August 2017, the Prime Minister issued Decision no. 1255/QD-Ttg approving the project to establish and complete the legal framework for management and handling of virtual assets, cryptocurrencies and virtual currencies. The purpose of the legal framework is to:
Regulate the ownership and property rights of the virtual assets, electronic money, virtual money
Protect the legitimate rights and interests of domestic and foreign investors in Vietnam; effectively limit, prevent and control related risks and abuses.
Identify and determine the attitude of state agencies towards related legal issues; propose specific tasks, duties and orientations to develop the regulations to ensure state management and control, minimize the risks while assuring the flexibility to adapt to changes in the continuous development of information technology and e-commerce 
Decision No. 1255/QD-Ttg is an important legal basis which lays the foundation for the future research and promulgation of legal regulations related to virtual currencies in Vietnam.  
Following Decision no. 1255/QD-Ttg, in April 2020, the MOF has established a working group to conduct research and propose policy content and management mechanisms according to the functions and tasks of the MOF related to virtual assets and virtual currency.
On 16 December 2020, the Prime Minister issued Decision no. 2117/QD-Ttg providing a list of prioritized sectors for research, development and application, including blockchain.
On 15 June 2021, the Prime Minister issued Decision no. 942/QD-Ttg approving a strategy for the development of e-government towards digital government for 2021-2025 with orientations towards 2030, which mentions the research, development and pilot usage of virtual currency based on blockchain technology.  
Most recently on 12 November 2021, the MOF issued Decision no. 2146/QD-BTC providing the general plan for implementation of solutions in the project “Tax management for e-commerce activities in Vietnam”.  According to this Decision, the MOF will co-ordinate with the Ministry of Justice and SBV to build a legal framework to manage cryptocurrency in accordance with international practice to mitigate tax evasion and money laundering.  In addition, there will be more mechanisms for banks to provide information on individuals’ bank accounts to the tax authority for effective tax management.
In light of the above progress, the legal framework for cryptocurrency is expected to be established and completed in near future.  While the legal framework is not available yet, the taxation on cryptocurrency trading in Vietnam remains ambiguous and subject to interpretation of tax authorities, including interpretation on classification of income type for taxation, taxability/non-taxability, income base for taxation and tax rates.  You should monitor further development in this regard for proper tax compliance and planning purposes.
