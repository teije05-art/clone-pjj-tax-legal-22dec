Overview of transfer pricing (“TP”) in Vietnam
Legal framework
Vietnam is not a member of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and is not therefore bound by the standards set out in the OECD TP Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations ("OECD Guidelines").  However, given Vietnam is a member to OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”), Vietnam’s prevailing TP legislation (i.e. Decree 132/2020/ND-CP - “Decree 132”) broadly aligns with the OECD Guidelines with certain unique local adaptations.  
Decree 132 applies to taxpayers paying Corporate Income Tax (“CIT”) that have related party transactions (“RPTs”).  Decree 132 applies to both domestic and cross-border RPTs.  It was issued on 5 November 2020 and took effect from 20 December 2020 and applies for the fiscal year 2020 onwards.    
Related party definition
In principle a related party is any entity deemed to have control over another entity via common ownership (more than 25% direct or indirect holding). 
The definition of related parties is also broadened to include other arrangements where an entity or individual is deemed to have control over another entity through capital transfers, loans and other special relationships.  Please refer to Annex 1 for details of the other conditions defining related parties.  
TP methodologies
Under Decree 132, there are five (5) acceptable methods for determining arm’s length pricing, which are analogous to those espoused by the OECD Guidelines:
Comparable uncontrolled price (“CUP”) method
Comparable profit margin methods, including:
Resale price method (“RPM”)
Cost plus method (“CPLM”)
Comparable net profit method (“CPM”)
Profit split method (“PSM”)
In general, the methods endorsed by the OECD Guidelines and Decree 132 are similar.  The most appropriate TP method(s) shall be selected in view of the nature and circumstances of the related party transaction, the nature of the transfer pricing method and the availability of reliable data needed to apply the selected method.
The standard arm’s length range
Decree 132 defines the standard arm’s length range to be from the 35th to 75th percentile value derived from at least five (5) independent comparable companies.  In case the results of the taxpayer fall outside the arm’s length range, the Vietnamese taxpayers are required to determine the most appropriate value within the standard arm’s length range to make a transfer pricing adjustment.  In the event of a transfer pricing adjustment initiated by local tax authorities during a tax or transfer pricing audit, local tax authority has the right to make a TP adjustment to the median value of the range.
Internal and external comparable data
Internal comparable data refers to transactions between one of the parties to the related party transaction and an unrelated party.  Decree 132 requires the use of internal data for comparability analysis, where applicable.  
In case internal comparable data is neither available, nor applicable to evaluate the arm’s length nature of the related party transactions, Decree 132 allows the use of external comparable data for comparability analysis.  External comparable data refers to transactions between two independent parties.
Selection of comparable companies
In general the minimum number of independent comparable companies to calculate the standard arm’s length range is five (5).  The use of local comparable companies for benchmarking analysis is also prioritized in Decree 132 and is, in practice, preferred by the Vietnamese tax authorities.
Reporting and documentation obligations
Annual reporting requirements under Decree 132 include 
TP declaration forms (appendices), and 
TP documentation package.
TP declaration forms (appendices)
Taxpayers who are subject to the TP rules are required to disclose information regarding their transfer pricing arrangement as part of their annual CIT finalization return.  The information to be disclosed is extensive and preparation of the forms can be relatively complex.
These forms (referred to as “Appendices”) are
Appendix I – Information on related parties and RPTs
Appendix II – List of information, documents required in Local File
Appendix III – List of information, documents required in Master File
Appendix IV – Country by Country report (“CbC Report”) (only applicable to Vietnamese ultimate parent company).
Appendices I, II and III shall be filed together with the annual CIT finalization return before the statutory submission deadline (i.e., the last day of the third month after the fiscal year end).  Please note that only the Vietnamese ultimate parent company with worldwide consolidated revenue exceeding VND 18,000 billion in a fiscal year is required to complete and lodge Appendix IV within 12 months from the end of that fiscal year.  
TP documentation
General rules
In addition to the above TP declaration forms, Vietnam also requires taxpayers to prepare and maintain a contemporaneous three-tier TP documentation that comprises of:
Local File: providing specific information regarding the taxpayer’s operations, RPTs and analysis on the pricing of RPTs;
Master File: providing standardised information relevant for all multinational enterprises group members such as group’s global business structure and activities; and group’s overall TP policies; and
CbC Report: providing aggregate data on the global allocation of income, profit, taxes paid and economic activity among tax jurisdictions in which the multinational enterprises operates.  
The Local File and Master File are required to be prepared before the annual CIT finalization return deadline.  Taxpayers are, however, only required to submit the Master File and Local File upon request from local tax authorities and these documents need to be in Vietnamese, specifically 
In the event of TP consultation: the deadline to submit TP documentation is within 30 working days (with one-time extension of up to 15 working days) upon receiving official request from the tax authority.
In the event of TP audit: the deadline to submit TP documentation (upon request of tax inspectors) shall be in accordance with the Law on Inspection, which does not specify the time frame for providing information.  This means that the taxpayers may have to provide the TP documentation within several days upon request from the inspectors.  
Local filing of the CbC Report
Foreign invested enterprises (“FIEs”) are not obligated to prepare and submit the CbC Report to the tax authority in Vietnam, if its foreign ultimate parent is not required to prepare the CbC Report in their respective jurisdiction.  Otherwise, in principle the Vietnamese Tax Authorities shall obtain such CbC Report from the respective overseas government through the automatic exchange of information (“AEOI”). However, local filing (upon request) is required if the CbC Report cannot be exchanged because:
There is no competent authority agreement between Vietnam and the respective overseas jurisdiction; or
Due to systematic failure of the exchange mechanism (e.g., suspension of the AEOI or the CbC Report not automatically provided to Vietnam).
Taxpayers that are subject to local filing of the CbC Report may opt to provide written notification to Vietnamese authorities, on or before the fiscal year end date of the ultimate parent company, in advance in the following cases: (i) where there are multiple subsidiaries in Vietnam, the ultimate parent company delegates the local filing obligation to one entity; or (ii) to provide information (name, tax code, jurisdiction) of the ultimate parent or the Surrogate Parent, if applicable.
TP Documentation exemption
A taxpayer is exempt from preparation of TP documentation package if any one of the following conditions is met:
Having only domestic RPTs and all respective related parties are subject to the same CIT rate, and none of the parties enjoys CIT incentives; or
Having annual revenue less than VND 50 billion and the total value of RPTs less than VND 30 billion; or 
Having a concluded Advance Pricing Agreement (“APA”) and has submitted the annual APA report in accordance with the APA regulations; or
Performing routine functions with annual revenue less than VND 200 billion, not generating revenue or incurring expense from exploitation and use of intangibles, and achieving at minimum the following operating margins for the respective functions: 5% for distribution; 10% for manufacturing; and 15% for processing.
Comparison with the OECD Guidelines
The following table highlights the key differences between Vietnam’s TP regulations (Decree 132) and the OECD Guidelines with respect to TP documentation.
TP audit environment
Overview and latest TP audit statistics
There has been significant increase in the number of TP audits conducted by the tax authorities and other governing bodies (e.g., customs authorities, State Auditor), adopting sophisticated approaches around such matters as:
TP compliance
TP of complex transactions, such as intra-group services, royalty payment for intangibles, and financial transactions
Validity the comparable companies selected in the TP documentation
Allocation of risks and accordingly profits for CIT purposes.

The following chart provides a summary of the recent TP audit statistics.

TP assessment and penalties
TP assessment
Non-compliance with mandatory disclosures and/or TP documentation may be subject to a transfer pricing adjustment in which additional taxes, penalties and late payment interest shall be imposed.  Specifically, the following cases are considered ‘non-compliance’:
The taxpayer fails to declare, declares insufficient information or does not submit Appendix I;
The taxpayer does not provide sufficient information of TP documentation or does not submit TP documentation based on the request of tax authorities within the permitted deadline;
The taxpayer uses dishonest and untruthful information of the independent transaction from illegal or improper or unclear source(s);
The taxpayer violates the regulations prescribed under Article 19 of Decree 132 (regarding ‘safe harbor’ rules as mentioned in Section 2.2.2 above) 
Penalties and late payment interest
The following penalties shall be applicable in case of a transfer pricing adjustment imposed by the tax authority:
Additional CIT liabilities
Penalty of 10% or 20% of the CIT shortfall amount (applicable from 1 July 2013) 
Late payment interest charge of 0.03%/day on the amount of late tax payment (applicable from 1 July 2016)
Other
Statute of limitations
The general statute of limitations for imposing additional tax liabilities and late payment interest is 10 years and for penalties is up to 5 years, except for cases such as fraud where statute of limitation may not be applicable.
TP dispute and resolution
Overview
Vietnamese taxpayers may consider the following to resolve or mitigate TP disputes:
Domestic remedies, such domestic appeal procedures and litigation;
Mutual agreement procedures (“MAP”) in accordance with the provisions of double taxation treaty to which Vietnam is a signatory; or
Advance Pricing Agreement (“APA”).
Practical considerations
Domestic appeal
Domestic appeal had previously been considered ineffective in resolving TP disputes.  Such perceptions are changing as more companies have been seeking relief through the domestic appeal procedures.
Moreover, the number of cases under domestic appeal have also increased due to increasingly aggressive stance taken by local authorities on TP matters.  Domestic appeal procedures start with a formal request to the local provincial tax department to reassess the case (i.e. the first appeal), and may escalate to the state / central administration (General Department of Tax / Ministry of Finance) (i.e. the second appeal) in case the taxpayer does not agree with the conclusion of the first appeal.  Further, if the taxpayer does not agree to the conclusion of the second appeal, they can subsequently take the case to court.    
Advance Pricing Agreement (“APA”)
Following the official introduction of the APA program in Vietnam in 2013, very few companies applied for APAs under the “pilot” program in the early years.  Starting in 2015, APA applications increased significantly, while resources (i.e., experienced staff) dedicated to reviewing and processing APAs remained limited at Vietnam’s GDT.  This led to a backlog of applications and lengthy review process.  Consequently, due to the lack of progress, the government temporarily suspended its review of outstanding APA applications in 2018.
In November 2020, the government issued Decree 126/2020/ND-CP (“Decree 126”) to revamp the APA program following the new Tax Administration Law (effective from July 1, 2020).  Decree 126 introduces a new legal framework, including administrative procedures, for the APA program.  In addition, Circular 45/2021/TT-BTC (“Circular 45”), which provides guidance on the application of Decree 126, was released in June 2021.
The relaunch of the APA program in Vietnam aims to expedite the review of APA applications and reduce the administrative burden on both the GDT and taxpayers.  In the context of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) and the increasing scrutiny on TP worldwide, it is anticipated there would be a greater interest in APAs in the coming years.  Given the new structure of the APA program, APA applications will be processed on a first-come basis.  Therefore, taxpayers interested in the APA program are encouraged to submit their APA applications as soon as possible to ensure their application will be prioritized for processing.
Mutual agreement procedures (“MAP”)
In case taxpayers’ transactions involve overseas related parties, taxpayers may consider seeking resolution through the Mutual Agreement Procedures (MAP), which requires Vietnamese tax authorities and respective overseas tax authorities to mutually resolve the double taxation implication resulting from the TP dispute. 
Vietnam has an extensive tax treaty network with around 80 tax treaties.  Due to the increasingly aggressive tax and TP positions taken by the tax authorities, more companies are seeking relief through MAP arbitration to resolve their double tax issues.      
Other matters
Considerations for intra-group services
In Vietnam, the CIT deductibility of intra-group services (“IGS”) is governed by the Vietnam’s CIT Law and Decree 132. 
In the recent years, local tax authorities have been taking aggressive stance on challenging the tax deduction for IGS charges by requiring taxpayers to provide evidence (in addition to standard documents to support the charges such as intercompany service agreements, invoices, etc.) that: 
The services have actually been rendered and provided direct economic benefits to the Vietnamese taxpayer.
The service charges were calculated based on the arm’s length principle (i.e. service fees are commensurate with the benefits received, the mark-up rate applied is substantiated by a benchmarking analysis, etc.).
The burden of proof lies with the local taxpayers.  Failure to provide sufficient evidence to address these issues will likely result in the tax authority’s disallowing the tax deduction of such IGS charges.
Intellectual property (“IP”)
The terms “royalty” and “license fee” are not specifically defined in any Vietnamese tax and commercial laws.  They are understood as payment for the right to use intangibles which include: (i) technology transfer (meaning technical information, know-how, and patents) and (ii) license of industrial properties (meaning trademark, trade secrets, and industrial design).
Deductibility of royalty/license fee requires consideration of both CIT and transfer pricing regulations.  Further, proper registration of the royalty/license agreement with the appropriate authorities, if applicable, is often required to claim tax deduction of the fees.
In practice, for royalty/license fee, tax authorities generally require evidences to prove that
The IP has economic value and provides benefit to the Vietnamese taxpayer
The licensor has the legal and economic ownership of the IP 
The licensor continues to carry out activities to develop, enhance, and protect the IP to justify the ongoing charges
Pricing of the royalty/license fee is arm’s length.
Interest deductibility cap
The interest deductibility cap rules under Decree 132 include:
The cap is set at 30% of total net operating profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
The interest expense subject to the cap calculation is the net amount, i.e. interest expense after offsetting against interest income (from deposits and loans). 
Non-deductible interest expense can be carried forward for future utilization for a maximum of five (5) years, provided that the interest expense of the future years does not exceed the 30% cap.
Certain government assistance loans are exempt from this interest limitation rule.
The question concerning the calculation of interest cap (30%) regarding capitalized interest is not specifically addressed in Decree 132, and so remains an area of uncertainty.
Frequently asked questions (“FAQ”)
The FAQ below are for general information purpose only and should not be used as a substitute for consultation with professional advisors.
Question 1
The ultimate parent company is not obligated to prepare Master File and CbC Report in Japan because it satisfies certain conditions for such exemption (e.g., consolidated revenue of the Japanese parent is below JPY 100 billion).  In this case, is the Vietnamese subsidiary still required to maintain Master File and CbC Report for Vietnamese TP compliance purposes? 
Answer
A copy of the ultimate parent’s CbC Report is required only if the ultimate parent is legally required to prepare the CbC Report in its respective tax jurisdiction (see Section 2.2.1).  Thus, if the Japanese ultimate parent is exempt from preparing CbC Report, the Vietnamese subsidiary shall also be exempt according to Decree 132.  
For Master File, unless otherwise satisfying the TP documentation exemption threshold (see Section 2.2.2), the Vietnamese subsidiary is required to maintain / prepare the Master File, even if the ultimate parent company is not obligated to prepare Master File in its respective tax jurisdiction (i.e. Japan).  


Question 2
In Japan the statutory deadline for filing the Master File and CbC Report is within one year following the fiscal year end of the ultimate parent. In case the Vietnamese subsidiary is not able to obtain the current Master File / CbC Report at the time of request from local tax authorities (because CbC Report for that year has not yet been prepared by the ultimate parent), what should the taxpayer do? 
Answer
For the Master File, the preparation due date for Vietnamese taxpayer is before the submission date of the annual tax return (see Section 2.2.1).  While a majority of the Master File contents required by Decree 132 could be complied to meet this deadline in Vietnam, it may not be possible to obtain certain information (such as Group’s audited financial statements because of Japan’s statutory deadlines).  A practical approach is to maintain all available information (e.g. draft financial data as at the due date in Vietnam) or information for the preceding year and document the underlying rationale.
For the CbC Report, a copy of the ultimate parent’s CbC Report may be required only if the ultimate parent is legally required to submit the CbC Report in its respective residence country (see Section 2.2.1).  Thus, if the CbC Report is not yet available upon request of the local tax authority, there is reasonable basis to explain that the Vietnamese subsidiary is not able to submit the ultimate parent’s CbC Report because such report has not yet been prepared by the ultimate parent.
Question 3
The company is a joint venture (see illustration below). Assuming all JV partners are required to prepare the Master File and CbC Report, which JV’s Master File and CbC Report should the Vietnamese subsidiary maintain to be compliant with Decree 132? Please refer to the diagram below:
Answer
For the Master File
As Decree 132 does not provide any guidance on this matter, to be prudent, the JV should maintain the Master Files of all three groups A, B and C. 
It is reasonable to argue that the JV only needs to maintain the Master Files of Group A and C because information on Group B may not be relevant to the JV’s business.
For the CbC Report
As Decree 132 does not provide any guidance on this matter, in theory, the JV may be required to provide copies of the CbC Reports of all three groups A, B and C.
However, since Vietnam is a member of the OECD Inclusive Framework on BEPS, the OECD “Guidance on the Implementation of Country-by-Country Reportingcan provide useful guidance. 
In the above example, if Group A, B and C follow a proportionate line-by-line consolidation for reporting the JV’s results in their respective consolidated financial statements, all three companies will be required to report the JV in their respective CbC Reports to the extent of their respective shares (i.e. 30%, 30% and 40%). Accordingly, the JV, in theory, may be required to provide copies of the CbC Reports of all three JV partners.
However, if any shareholder (for example Group B) uses the equity method of accounting for reporting the JV’s results in their respective consolidated financial statements, it is reasonable to suggest that Group B would not be required to report the JV in its respective CbC Report.  Accordingly, it is arguable that the CbC Report of Group B is not relevant to the JV.
Another concern is that the JV partners may not want/allow their highly confidential information contained in the CbC Report(s) to be made available to the other JV partner.  
Question 4
Does Decree 132 accept the use of regional comparable data (e.g. Asia Pacific data) for comparability (benchmarking) analysis purposes? In practice, is it also accepted by the local tax authority? 
Answer
Yes. Even though Decree 132 prioritizes the use of local Vietnamese data for benchmarking purposes, in case local data is not available (or not appropriate), the use of regional data is permissible according to the local TP regulations.  
Please note that when regional data is used, the local TP regulations require comparability adjustments, such as differences in location/market, to account for factors that could have material impact on pricing / profit margins. However, Decree 132 does not provide any guidance on how to actually make such adjustments. In practice, the impact of such factors on the taxpayer’s business could be highly subjective and often difficult to quantify.

As mentioned in Section 1.5, while the use of regional data is permissible, local comparable data for benchmarking purposes is generally preferred by the local tax authority. 


Question 5
Does Decree 132 give the tax authority the power to use the government’s internal databases (i.e. the so-called ‘secret’ comparables) for TP assessment purpose? 
Answer
Yes. While the use of secret comparables should be limited to TP risk assessment purposes according to the TP regulations, in practice, tax officials still use secret comparables in case a taxpayer is ‘deemed’ noncompliant with the requirements of Decree 132 (e.g. failure to provide TP documentation upon request, etc.). 

Question 6
One of the conditions for TP documentation exemption refers to the term “simple functions”.  How can taxpayer determine whether its functions are ‘simple’? 
Answer
Unfortunately, Decree 132 does not provide clear definition/guidance for the term “simple functions”.  Nevertheless, it may be helpful to refer to Clause 2d, Article 14 of Decree 132, which states that: 
“Taxpayers doing business by performing their routine functions, without performing strategic decision-making functions and engaging in transactions of low added value comprise production or distribution enterprises which are not exposed to inventory risk or market risk and do not have sales revenue or costs arising from uses of intangible assets, shall not have to incur operating losses arising from these risks.”
Annex 1 – Related party definition 
Article 5 of Decree 132 provides the following definitions on the relationship of related parties:
“1. Enterprises with associated relations (below referred as “related parties”) mean parties having relations that fall in one of following cases:
a) One party participates directly or indirectly in management or control of or capital contribution to or investment in the other party;
b) All parties are directly or indirectly managed or controlled or have capital contributed by another party. 
2. The related parties under Clause 1 above are specifically regulated as follows:

b) Both enterprises have at least 25% of the owner’s contributed capital held directly or indirectly by another party;
c) One enterprise which is the biggest shareholder regarding the owner’s contributed capital and directly or indirectly holds at least 10% of total number of shares of the other enterprise;
d) One enterprise guarantees or gives loans to the other enterprise in any form (including loans from third party which are guaranteed by related party’s financial resources and other financial transactions with the similar nature) provided that such loans account for at least 25% of contributed capital of the owner of the borrowing enterprise and account for over 50% of the total value of medium-term and long-term loans of the borrowing enterprise;
đ) One enterprise appoints members of the board of management to manage or control the other enterprise provided that the number of members appointed by the former accounts for more than 50% of the total members of the board of management which have the executive power or control of the latter; or a member appointed by the former has the right to make decisions on financial policies or business activities of the latter;
e) Both enterprises have more than 50% of the number of members of their board of management or have the same member of their boards of management who has the right to make decisions on financial policies or business activities and is appointed by another party;
g) Two enterprises are managed or controlled in personnel, financial and business affairs by individuals being members of a family who have relations between husband and wife, biological parents, adoptive parents, stepfather, stepmother, parents-in-law on the wife's side; parents-in-law on the husband's side, biological children, adopted children, stepchildren of the wife or husband, daughter-in-law, son-in-law; siblings of the same parents, siblings of the same father and different mother, siblings of the same mother and different father, brother-in-law, sister-in-law of the person with the same parents or the same father and different mother or he same mother and different father; paternal grandparents, maternal grandparents; paternal grandchildren, maternal grandchildren; biological aunt and uncle, biological niece and nephew;
h) Two business establishments have a relation of headquarter and permanent establishment or both of them are permanent establishments of a foreign organization or individual;
i) Enterprises are under control of one individual through the capital contribution made by such individual or due to such individual’s direct management in the enterprises;
k) Other cases where one enterprise participates in management, control over actual decisions in relation to the business operation of the other enterprise;
l) One enterprise has transaction being the transfer or receipt of transfer of at least 25% of the owner’s contributed capital in a tax period; borrows or lends at least 10% of the owner’s contributed capital at the time of arising transactions in a tax period with an individual who manages or controls over the enterprise, or with an individual under one of the relationships as prescribed in point g of this clause.”
