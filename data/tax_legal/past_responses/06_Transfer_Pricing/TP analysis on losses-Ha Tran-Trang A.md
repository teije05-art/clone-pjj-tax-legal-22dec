Thank you for your trust in KPMG services. We refer to our engagement letter dated 20 January 2020 regarding the Ad-hoc Tax and Transfer pricing advisory services (“the Agreement”) between You and KPMG Tax and Advisory Limited (“KPMG”) in respect of tax and transfer pricing implications of the Company’s loss-making position in FY2018-FY2019. We are pleased to provide hereunder our responses to your queries/ concern and recommendations for your perusal.
Background information
CLIENT was established under Investment Registration Certificate (“IRC”) No. XXXXX398729 dated dd mm yy by Hai Phong Economic Zone Authority as a 100% foreign-invested company owned by “the Parent Co”. The Company is primarily engaged in the production of gloves, including leather gloves, sports gloves and other types of gloves. Under the current IRC, CLIENT is entitled to the Corporate Income Tax (“CIT”) incentives of 2-year CIT exemption and 4-year 50% CIT deduction, starting from the first year of having taxable income.
In FY2018-FY2019, the Company was in start-up phase and suffered losses. CLIENT is considering several options to treat the losses in compliance with prevailing Vietnamese tax and transfer pricing regulations. The company has raised several questions as follows:
Question 1: How to treat the loss of FY2018? What are the possible solutions?
Question 2: How to prove that prices are in accordance with arm’s length principle?
Question 3: What are potential customs and tax risks that may arise relating to the year-end adjustment in FY2018? Should an adjustment for FY2018 be made?
Question 4: For FY2019, CLIENT’s parent company – has decided to compensate CLIENT on a full cost basis with a mark-up of 5%. Is this rate reasonable? Would the excessive profit be subject to any taxes in Vietnam?
Question 5: What is the proper method to calculate the transfer pricing adjustments when the Company incurred intra-group interest cost?
Given this, CLIENT has sought for KPMG’s professional services in addressing the Company’s concerns relating to these options from tax and transfer pricing perspectives.
Under our agreed scope of work, we have thoroughly studied questions raised by CLIENT based on prevailing regulations and provided our comments and recommendations hereunder for your perusal. 
Legal basis
Our comments and advice presented herein are made based on the information provided by CLIENT and the applicable regulations specified in Appendix I.
Our comments 
For your ease of information, we provide hereunder our comments and responses beneath your each and every query.
Question 1 - How to treat the loss of FY2018? What are the possible solutions?
Question 3: What are potential customs and tax risks that may arise relating to the year-end adjustment in FY2018? Should an adjustment for FY2018 be made?
Despite the Company’s recorded accounting loss of USD577,039, the tax loss reported in its 2018 CIT finalization return was USD434,139 after its making CIT adjustment in respect of some non-deductible expenses (including USD63,361 of loan interest, USD77,536 of salary for workers from September 2018 to March 2019, and USD2,002 of expenses without financial invoices).  This tax loss may be carried forward in the subsequent year(s) under the Vietnamese tax regulations.
The Company may consider one of the following loss treatment methods for FY2018, together with its tax/ customs/ transfer pricing implications below:
Option 1 - Leave the loss of FY2018 as it is, and hence no related transfer pricing adjustment 
Under this option, the Company should prepare sufficient supporting documents and rationales to justify the loss which was attributable to non-transfer pricing factors as follows:
Significant start-up costs during establishment and first year operation period;
The Company’s limited orders and high idle production capacity during the year;
Relatively similar method of determination of processing fees in HMSE’s related party transactions (with CLIENT) and unrelated party transactions (with third party processing contractor).  That is, a potential internal Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) method may be applied in this case from HMSE’s perspective, subject to further and detailed analysis for comparability factors for the purposes of applying the CUP in this case; and
CLIENT was not subject to TP documentation obligations in FY2018 due to the Company’s small scale of business (i.e. revenue under VND50 billion and related party transaction value under VND30 billion). So, there would not be basis (i.e. Benchmarking analysis) for the Company’s adjustment of losses.
From corporate tax perspective, under our observation during tax audits, the tax authority tends to accept the losses incurred by the tax payers in the first year of establishment. Challenges are usually raised on the legitimacy of expenses incurred during this first year and subsequently losses are adjusted to an acceptable level from tax perspective rather than fully rejected, which could be addressed by maintaining sufficient supporting documents for the expenses incurred. 
From a transfer pricing perspective, unlike OECD Guidelines, the current Vietnamese transfer pricing regulations do not have specific provisions allowing tax payers to explain loss in the start-up phase, or due to market/ economic conditions.  Instead, the Vietnamese transfer pricing regulations promulgate that in case there are any significant differences between controlled/ uncontrolled transactions, and/ or test party and comparables, tax payers should make adjustment to such differences, which however may not be reliably carried out for the purpose of a transfer pricing analysis. Given this, there might be a possibility that the local tax authorities would be of the view that the Company’s loss making in FY2018 was due to transfer pricing factor. Failure to provide further analysis to support its position (e.g. the CUP analysis as mentioned above), the Company might be subject to transfer pricing adjustment by tax authority in FY2018.

Option 2 - Voluntarily make adjustment to the operating result of FY2018 to an arm’s length profit level
From TP perspective, such voluntarily adjustment is allowed under the current regulations. For TP purposes, the below documents are required:
A benchmarking analysis is required to support the arm’s length nature of the targeted price/ profit margin for adjustment; and 
HMSE and CLIENT also need to consider revisiting the current Processing contract to specify the target price/ profit margin of CLIENT in providing the processing service to form the basis for TP adjustment.
However, there is no clear guidance under both TP and CIT regulations for making year-end adjustment. The Company can consider the two sub-options under Option 2 as below:
Option 2.1 - Adjustment of processing service fee
Form of adjustment: The adjustment to CLIENT’s 2018 operating result could be made by increasing the processing price charged from CLIENT to HMSE during the financial year. Under the current CIT regulations, the increase in revenue must be supported by amended invoices and accordingly amended customs declaration forms.
Requirements under current regulations: In case of revenue adjustment, the Company is required to take the following actions:
preparing an agreement with HMSE on the adjustment of the processing service fee specifying in which proper reasons for the adjustment;
signing minutes stating clearly the calculation of adjustment amount and clear explanation for the proposed adjustment;
issuing amendment invoices for the adjustments; and 
amending relevant custom declarations. 
Invoice amendment: Under the current regulations on invoicing, technically businesses are allowed to issue amendment invoices for any invoices that are found to be incorrectly issued. As there will be quite a lot of invoices to be amended, we observe in practice that the local tax authority, in their various official letters providing guidance to other cases, would allow one (01) amendment invoice for all changed invoices provided that a detailed list of invoices to be amended and a minutes stating clearly the calculation of adjustment amount must be attached to such amendment invoice. For prudence, the company may consider seeking the same official guidance from the Hai Phong tax authority to take into account the specific facts and circumstances of the company.
Customs implications: There are specific requirements and timeline for amendment of Customs Declaration form (CD form), e.g. 60 days after customs clearance date and before the customs authority performs post customs clearance audit, and some administrative penalties will incur if the amendment is made after that timeline.
CLIENT will need to submit a written letter to the customs authority specifying the reasons for amending CD form, which will be subject to acceptance from the customs authority. Also, the whole Customs Declaration dossier (i.e. the CD form, packing list, commercial invoice, payment voucher, etc.) needs to be amended accordingly and consistently. Of note, in practice, the process of amending CD form can be quite time consuming with a lot of administrative tasks.  
Potential exposure: 
From corporate tax perspective, the above mentioned invoice amendment would increase the revenue and possibly trigger taxable income of the Company in FY2018. Thus, the associated risk of the tax authority’s challenge on this invoice amendment may be low. 
Nevertheless, since this is a related party transaction with significant value of the Company, it would be subject to careful review and assessment of the tax authority in the future tax audit. In case the tax authority reasonably believe that the adjustment of processing price is in nature the parent company’s support to CLIENT to cover its accumulated loss, the additional revenue raised from such processing price adjustment may not be accepted by the tax authority to be the Company’s operating income. Rather, the Company would be required to record such revenue as Other Income being the financial support from the parent company to CLIENT.
Under current regulations, as the Company is entitled to CIT incentives applicable to encouraged location, the income entitled to CIT incentives will be all the income generated from business activities performed in that location in connection with the activities registered under the investment project. In consideration that the financial support from the parent company is not generated from the Company’s registered business activities, the Company might not be allowed to apply CIT incentives on that other income.
Notwithstanding the above, under prevailing regulations, the Company is allowed to offset the loss from the business activities entitled CIT incentives with the gain of the income-generating activities. The remaining income after offset shall be subject to the corresponding CIT rate of the income-generating activities.
As such, the surplus adjustment after offsetting with the current loss of FY2018 would be subject to normal CIT rate (currently at 20%).

Option 2.2 - Make a TP adjustment under the form of a Debit note
Given the difficulty of Option 2.1 above, per our observation from local practice, some tax payers opt to make direct transfer pricing adjustment in the form of credit/ debit note based on the mutual agreement on the target margin to be earned by the Vietnamese subsidiary as specified in the contract and make direct amendment to their CIT tax return.  
However, given the absence of guidance on how to make the TP adjustment and in the absence of supporting documents as basis and evidence for such adjustment (e.g. contract, memorandum on reason for adjustment, supporting invoices and relevant accounting documents), the amount of TP adjustment may be considered Other Income for CIT purposes and may not be able to enjoy the current CIT incentives as we have mentioned earlier, i.e. the surplus adjustment after offsetting with the current loss is subject to normal CIT rate (currently at 20%). 
We would like to further note that in Vietnam, the simple use of credit or debit notes for revenue adjustments is not familiar to the local tax authorities. As such, there might be a potential risk that without proper supporting documents as basis and evidence for such adjustment (e.g. contract, memorandum on reason for adjustment, supporting invoices and relevant accounting documents), the local tax authority may question whether the Company has provided certain services to domestic customers and insist that the Company has to pay VAT accordingly on that income. From our experience, this risk however may be remote subject that the Company maintain proper supporting documents to prove the nature of the true-up transactions.
Question 2 - How to prove that prices are in accordance with arm’s length principle 
CLIENT provided processing services to HMSE with regard to glove products and received processing fee as its revenue. 
The tax law in general requires that prices in any business transactions are in line with market price.
The Company’s related party transactions are also subject to application of the arm’s length principle, as stipulated in the Tax Administration Law and transfer pricing regulations under Decree 20/2017/ND-CP (“Decree 20”) and Circular 41/2017/TT-BTC (“Circular 41”). 
To prove the arm’s length nature of the incurred related party transactions, CLIENT can choose to apply, among the five (05) methods provided under Decree 20 and Circular 41, one or more methods which are the most appropriate to the nature and circumstances of the transaction, the availability of reliable data needed to apply the selected method, and the nature of the transfer pricing method.
The methods provided under Vietnamese TP regulations and our comments on the appropriateness of each method for CLIENT provision of processing service are as below:
Comparable Uncontrolled Price (“CUP”) method
CUP method seeks to compare price of goods or services in a controlled transaction with the price levied in comparable uncontrolled transactions (i.e. a transaction between independent parties) in comparable circumstances.
As mentioned above, there is potential data to perform the comparison of processing service fee paid from HMSE to CLIENT with the fee HMSE paid to unrelated processing company in Vietnam for the similar services. 
This, however, requires detailed analysis of comparability factors, including characteristics/ scope of services, contractual terms of the transactions being compared; and conditions of market where the transactions took place.
Resale Price Method (“RPM”)
The RPM seeks to determine the arm’s length price of a related party transaction by deducting an appropriate gross profit margin from the selling price to a third party. RPM is ordinarily used in situations involving the purchase and resale of tangible property where the distributor has not added substantial value to the goods by altering them before resale.
In CLIENT’s case, the general conditions for the application of RPM are not satisfied since the Company is a contract processor/ manufacturer, not a distributor.
Cost Plus Method (“CPLM”)
Under the CPLM, the gross cost plus mark-up of the supplier in the controlled transaction will be benchmarked with the cost plus mark-up applied in uncontrolled transactions, both internal and external where applicable. The CPLM is generally applied for manufacturers who do not own any intangible assets and assume a low level of risks as they manufacture/ assemble goods on a contract basis, conduct toll manufacturing activities, and/or provide services to related parties on a contract basis. 
Regarding the contemplated TP adjustment being considered by HMSE and CLIENT where the mark-up will be on total cost (i.e. net cost plus), CPLM is not the appropriate TP method to test the arm’s length nature of CLIENT’s prices in related party transactions.
Profit Split Method (“PSM”)
PSM may be applied where the taxpayers participate in the development of new products or an exclusive intangible property that contributes to the overall profitability of a particular transaction, or where the business transactions between related parties, from the procurement of materials to the completion of the final products for distribution, is associated with the ownership or use of a unique intellectual property, or taxpayers participate in the development, enhancement, maintenance, protection, and exploitation (“DEMPE”) of an exclusive intangible property, or taxpayers participate in digital related party transactions without any basis for the determination of the prices between related parties; or taxpayers participate in the creation of added values which are the result of the group’s synergies; or taxpayers perform full-fledge function with regard to the entire business and production process. In general, the PSM is normally used when the operations of the related parties are highly integrated. 
As a manufacturing entity owned by Parent Company, CLIENT does not own or contribute towards the creation or DEMPE of any valuable, non-routine unique intangible property. Besides, CLIENT neither participates in any digital related party transactions nor creates any added values received from the synergies of the group nor performs full-fledge function regarding the entire business and production process. CLIENT’s business activities and the processing services provided to HMSE are not so integrated that a profit split analysis is required. 
As such, PSM is not the appropriate transfer pricing method to test the arm’s length nature of CLIENT’s related party transactions.
Comparable Profits Method (“CPM”)
The CPM examines whether or not the net profit margins realized from controlled transactions are at arm’s length by comparing the net profit indicator of an enterprise with related party transactions to those earned by independent enterprises. The CPM is considered as an extension of the application of the RPM and CPLM. 
CPM is applied in cases where the taxpayer does not have information to apply the CUP method; does not have data and information for the application of the RPM and CPLM; performs functions of distribution or manufacturing but does not own intangible asset or does not engage in the process of DEMPE of the intangible asset; or does not fall into cases where the PSM is applied.
In other words, CPM will be chosen as the most appropriate method if other methods are not applicable.
Also considering the 5% net cost plus mark-up proposed by HMSE and CLIENT, it is reasonable that CPM will be the most appropriate method for testing whether that 5% mark-up is an arm’s length remuneration for the processing services provided from CLIENT, based on official benchmarking analysis. Decree 20 and Circular 41 generally require that the prices/ profit level of related party transactions fall within the standard arm’s length/ market range, which is from the first quartile value to the third quartile value of inter-quartile range established by the independent comparable prices/ profit level.
In addition, CLIENT is required to fulfill your documentation obligations, including preparation of TP documentation package and declaration forms, as stated in the above regulations. 
Please refer to Appendix II and Appendix III for more details on Transfer pricing method and Transfer pricing compliance obligations under Decree 20.
Question 4: For FY2019, CLIENT’s parent company – has decided to compensate CLIENT on a full cost basis with a mark-up of 5%. Is this rate reasonable? Would the excessive profit be subject to any taxes in Vietnam?
As mentioned above, an official benchmarking analysis is required to test whether the 5% mark-up is within the interquartile range, which is from the first quartile value to the third quartile value of inter-quartile range established by the independent comparable prices/ profit level. Under the Vietnamese regulations, in case of transfer pricing adjustments by the local tax authorities, they are allowed to make adjustment based on median of the interquartile range or more.  As such, practically, for prudence, tax payers’ operating results should be equal or above the median of the interquartile range.
Without the official benchmarking analysis, based on our observation and experience of local practice, a mark-up of 5% appears to be at the mid-lower side for a routine processing company.  Again, the Company is strongly recommended to carry out an official benchmarking analysis to support the mark-up applied.
From tax perspective, this compensation will be considered as income from financial support of HMSE to CLIENT. Per guidance under several tax rulings issued by local tax authorities, this income will be recognized as other income for tax purpose and subject to standard CIT rate of 20%.
Following the principle to offset gain and loss of different business activities in the same tax period as previously mentioned, the 5% mark-up, being CLIENT’s gain after offsetting loss of main business activities in FY2019 with income due to financial support from HMSE, will not be entitled to CIT incentives and subsequently apply standard CIT rate under current regulations.
Accordingly, CLIENT will be obliged to pay CIT upon the 5% mark-up in FY2019 unless the loss of FY2018 is available to carry forward and utilize.
Question 5 - Calculation of the transfer pricing adjustments with incurred intra-group interest cost incurred 
Regarding the contemplated TP adjustment, according to Point 2, Article 7, Decree 20 regarding comparable net profit ratio method (i.e. CPM method), net profit does not include the difference in financial income and financial expenses. Therefore, for TP adjustment purposes, interest expenses should not be included in the total cost base for applying the 5% mark-up.
Treatment of intra-group interest expenses in FY2018 & FY2019
Under current CIT regulations, intra-group interest cost, with legitimate supporting documents (i.e. invoice/debit note, loan agreement, registration with State Bank of Vietnam (“SBV”) for offshore loans) will be considered as deductible expenses for CIT purpose, except for the following cases:

Interest expenses corresponding to the un-contributed charter capital;

Interest expenses exceeding 20% of the Company’s Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) (hereinafter referred to as “the 20% cap rule”)
For Case ii, as CLIENT has various transactions with its related parties, in accordance with Point 3, Article 8, Decree 20, total interest expenses incurred in the tax period, which are deductible for determination of taxable income should not exceed 20% of taxpayer’s net profit before EBITDA, with EBITDA being calculated as follow:
Although prevailing regulations do not have a specific guidance on how to treat a negative EBITDA, our observations from local practices and response/ treatment of some provincial tax authorities have shown that a negative EBITDA can pose a potential risk of the whole interest expenses not being considered deductible for CIT purposes. So, where the Company opt to keep the loss of FY2018 as it is, it is highly likely that the whole interest expenses paid to HMSE would be treated as non-deductible expenses for CIT purposes.
Of note, the Vietnam Government is considering the amendment to Decree 20, which adds specific details to the above Article 8, which is expected to be effective for fiscal year 2019. 
Specifically, per the latest draft amendment, the cap for total net interest expenses per EBITDA ratio is increased to 30%. Interest expense subject to the cap is the net interest after offsetting interest expense against interest income. Of note, this new cap and approach for determining interest expense subject to cap might still be subject to change until it is officially approved by the Government.
Based on the above facts, and given the Company is considering the 5% mark-up profit after adjustment, which would result in positive EBITDA, we suggest the Company consider and prepare a scenario for FY2019 where the ratio is increased to 30% of EBITDA applicable on net interest expense only, which can be adopted when the amendment to Decree 20 comes into effect in the near future.
However, since this gain is highly likely considered as other income, it will not be taken into account when calculating EBITDA per statutory formula mentioned above and eventually has no impact to the Company’s deductible interest expense. As such, all interest expenses incurred in FY2019 will be subject to CIT adjustment regardless of whether compensation for business loss is implemented or not.
Our recommendations for FY2020 onwards
How to handle TP adjustments for FY2020
As aforementioned, since there is a lack of guidance on tax treatment of the TP adjustments or in CLIENT’s case, inbound true-ups or CLIENT’s adjustment to past processing service fee may trigger the scrutiny of local tax authorities as well as may not be feasible in practice due to difficulties in customs declaration form. 
Going forward for FY2020, to mitigate potential risks and difficulties, we have the following comments and recommendations for your consideration:
Make sure that the selected TP method for processing fee is followed and applied consistently in practice
As understand from our various discussion, Parent Company decides that the remuneration for processing services provided by CLIENT will be cost plus 5%. In implementing such TP method, please note:
Among five transfer pricing methods under Decree 20, the cost plus method is typically and commonly applied in the context of a company that provides services to its related parties. On this basis, selection of CPLM as the transfer pricing method for processing fee in the case of CLIENT appears to be consistent with the local transfer pricing regulations. 
CLIENT needs to make sure that the cost base (including both direct and indirect costs) is fully-absorbed in the final price (i.e. processing fee), taking into account changes in actual cost from time to time.
The 5% mark-up must be supported by an official benchmarking analysis to prove it is arm’s length.
Where the processing fee is agreed in advance based on budgeted/ historical costs, CLIENT should review the actual cost against budgeted cost on a monthly/quarterly basis to identify any variances and process adjustment where needed.
Implement TP adjustment to minimize customs implications
To avoid customs implication, there should not be cases where CLIENT need to revise the customs dossier. In order to do so, the Company can consider phased adjustment of processing fee (where needed) into the prices of next shipment (i.e. next invoice and customs declarations) instead of revision of past invoices. For example, when reviewing the performance of Quarter I 2020, it appears that CLIENT is making 3% net profit instead of the targeted 5%, the 2% difference should be included in the pricing for Quarter II and reflected into the processing fee charged for Quarter II accordingly and appropriately.

Maintain sufficient supporting documents
In line with the above, we recommend CLIENT maintain documents to support the nature of the transaction and the necessary TP adjustments. Specifically:
A processing contract or amendment to contract which clearly states the pricing mechanism of processing fee between CLIENT and HMSE (e.g. prices will be updated on a quarterly basis, reflecting changes in actual cost during business operation);
The Group policy which incorporates a clause specifying a targeted profit/profit margin for each subsidiary including CLIENT;
Forms and documentation in compliance with accounting, tax and transfer pricing regulations, including accounting vouchers, agreements, invoices, etc. together with the Forms and TP documentation package (with benchmarking analysis to prove the arm’s length nature of the mark-up applied).
For long term benefit, the Company may apply for an Advanced Pricing Agreement – APA to the competent tax authorities in respect of the selected transfer pricing policy.  Where there is any deviation to transfer prices/ gross profit/ profit margin which has been agreed to the local competent authorities under the APA, CLIENT will be allowed to make necessary transfer pricing adjustments – both upward and downward - as noted under the prevailing APA regulations. Also note that APA cannot be applied retrospectively in Vietnam. We are happy to assist you on this matter under a separate engagement, if requested.
Non-deductible interest expenses
In case you have concern over “double taxation” both in Sweden and in Vietnam in relation to these interests and would like to consider converting these loans into contributed capital of CLIENT in the future, per our verbal discussion with our legal team, it is permissible under Vietnamese regulations and you will need to register and update IRC & ERC of CLIENT for this change. The registration process should not be cumbersome and time consuming in practice. 
Should you wish to consider the pros and cons of this arrangement from both tax and licensing perspectives, KPMG tax and legal teams are intensively experienced in business re-structuring arrangements and are willing to assist you on this under a separate engagement if requested.

Appendix II – Transfer Pricing Methods
Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method
CUP method seeks to compare price(s) of the transfer of goods or services in a controlled transaction (i.e. a transaction between related parties) with the price levied in comparable uncontrolled transactions (i.e. a transaction between independent parties) in comparable circumstances.  
In practice, there are two types of comparable uncontrolled transactions. The first, known as an ‘internal comparable’, is a comparable transaction between one of the parties to the related party transaction and an unrelated party. The second, known as an ‘external comparable’, is a transaction between two independent parties, each unrelated to the parties engaged in the controlled transaction.
As a comparison principle provided for in Decree 20, preference is given to an internal comparable transaction provided that this is not created or rearranged from a related party transaction.
Therefore, in order to apply either the internal or external CUP method, it is necessary to identify transactions with or between unrelated parties and then to ascertain whether the circumstances surrounding, and conditions attached to the transactions are truly comparable with those surrounding the controlled transactions.
In a CUP analysis, where material differences in the factors and circumstances between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions exist, consideration must be given to adjust for the effect of the differences.  According to Decree 20, CUP method can be applied where either:
None of the differences in terms of product characteristics and contractual terms between the transactions being compared could materially affect the price; or
Reasonably accurate adjustments can be made to eliminate the effect of the material differences.
Decree 20 provides for a number of key comparability factors that should be taken into account when seeking to apply CUP method.  The key factors include:
Characteristics, quality, brand name and trademark of products as well as scope and volume of transactions;
Contractual terms in providing and delivering products: volume and timeline of delivery, credit terms and other contractual conditions; and
Rights to distribute and sell goods, services and assets which affect the economic value, and the market where transactions are conducted.
Other comparability factors affecting the price of products might include economic conditions and functions performed by taxpayers.

Comparison of profit margin methods
Comparison of profit margin methods seek to compare taxpayers’ profit ratios with independent comparable companies’ profit ratios.
Comparison of profit margin methods are applied in the cases where taxpayers do not have sufficient database and information to apply CUP method or taxpayers cannot compare transactions of products on the basis of each transaction in a specific type of comparable products or taxpayers do not perform full-fledge function of the entire business and production chain or do not participate in any typically integrated related party transaction.
According to Decree 20, comparison of profit margin methods can be applied where either:
None of the differences in functions performed, assets and risks; economic conditions and accounting methods could materially affect profit ratio when comparing taxpayers with independent comparables. 
Reasonably accurate adjustments can be made to eliminate the effect of the material differences.
Decree 20 provides for a number of key comparability factors that should be taken into account when seeking to apply CUP method.  The key factors include:
Functions performed, assets used, risks assumed: assets, capital, costs; the actual right to control and make decision for the purpose of performing main functions of taxpayer; the nature of business lines, production market, consumption market; 
Accounting method, cost structure of products; and
Economic conditions where transactions are conducted.
Other comparability factors are products characteristics and contractual terms.
Comparison of profit margin methods use gross profit ratio or net profit ratio of selected independent comparables to determine the corresponding gross profit ratio or the net profit ratio of the taxpayers.  The selection of profit ratio includes gross profit ratio and net profit ratio over revenues, costs or assets depends on the nature and economic conditions of the transaction; functions of taxpayer and accounting methods of parties involved.
Decree 20 and Circular 41 provide for the following three (03) kinds of comparison of profit margin methods which are discussed in detail as follows:
Resale Price Method
RPM seeks to determine the arm’s length price of a related party transaction by deducting an appropriate gross profit margin from the selling price to a third party and some related expenses included in the purchasing prices (e.g. import duties; customs fees; insurance and transportation fees (if any), etc.).  The margin represents the amount from which a reseller would seek to cover its selling and other operating expenses in the light of the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed, and make an appropriate profit. Like CUP method, RPM can involve either ‘internal’ or ‘external’ comparisons.
RPM is ordinarily used in “distributor” situations involving the purchase and resale or distribution of tangible property purchased from related parties in which the distributor does not create intangible asset accompanied with products sold; does not engage in the process of developing, enhancing, maintaining, protecting the intangible asset accompanied with products sold which is owned by the related parties or does not perform activities of processing, fabricating, installing which lead a change in characteristic of products, does not pin trade mark to increase the value of products.
According to Circular 41, specific factors that may have material impacts on gross margin include:
Expenses reflecting enterprise’s functions as a sales agent, an exclusive distributor, or a marketing distributor; 
Growth and development level of product consumption market; 
Taxpayer’s functions in the supply chain such as wholesale, retail sale; and 
Accounting methods.
Cost Plus Method
Under CPLM, arm’s length transfer prices are established by reference to the costs incurred by the supplier of property (or services) in a controlled transaction with a related party.  An appropriate mark-up is then added to this cost, based on the mark up added by independent parties to the cost of goods or services in comparable uncontrolled transactions.  
The gross cost plus mark-up of the supplier in the controlled transaction should ideally be established by reference to the cost plus mark-up that the same supplier earns in a comparable uncontrolled transaction (i.e. an internal comparison). Where this is not possible, the cost plus mark-up may be established by reference to the cost plus mark-up that independent enterprises earn in comparable uncontrolled transactions (i.e. an external comparable).
CPLM is ordinarily used in cases where the taxpayer does not own intangible asset and assumes limited business risks and performs functions of contract manufacturing, toll manufacturing, assembling, manufacturing, product processing, equipment installation; purchase and supply of products; provision of service or carrying out research and development activities on a contract basis for related parties. CPLM is not applied to taxpayers who are full-fledge manufacturing enterprises performing research and development activities, trademark and brand name creation, market strategies, goods warranty and customers support services.
According to Circular 41, specific factors that have material impacts on a gross cost plus mark-up include:
Expenses reflecting enterprise’s functions such as contractual manufacturing assigned by the parent company or provision of intra group services; 
Contractual terms such as product delivery time, cost of quality control, storage, payment terms; and 
Accounting methods applied to determine cost of goods sold of the taxpayer and independent comparables.  
Comparable Profits Method 
CPM examines whether or not the net profit margins realised from controlled transactions are arm’s length by comparing the financial results of an enterprise with related party transactions with the financial results earned by independent enterprises. Profit comparisons at the net margin level are an extended application of RPM and CPLM. The difference is that CPM examines the net profit margin, rather than the gross profit margin relative to an appropriate base, e.g. sales, costs or assets.
CPM is applied in cases where the taxpayer does not have information to apply the CUP method; data and information on the accounting method of independent comparables, or unable to select comparable companies with comparable functions and products for the application of RPM and CPLM; taxpayer who performs functions of distribution or manufacturing but does not own intangible asset or does not engage in the process of developing, enhancing, maintaining, protecting and exploiting the intangible asset; or does not fall into cases where PSM is applied (refer to Section 8.1.3 for details).
According to Circular 41, specific factors that have material impacts on net profit margins include:
Functions, assets and risks; 
Economic conditions; 
Contractual terms; and 
Characteristics of products. 
Profit Split Method 
PSM divides the combined profit arising from the controlled transactions between the transacting related parties on the basis of what would be economically anticipated if the enterprises had been transacting at arm’s length.  
Taxpayer’s adjusted profit shall be split on the basis of the total profit of related party transactions, including actual profit and projected profit possibly earned by related parties.
Taxpayer’s adjusted profit includes the total of contribution profit and residual profit. The contribution profit is calculated in accordance with comparison of profit margin methods. The residual profit is calculated based on the profit split ratio which is based on one or more factors such as revenues, costs, assets or human resources of related parties participating in the transactions and must be compliant with the arm’s length principle.
If there is insufficient information and data to split the adjusted profit as regulated above, the split can be based on one or more factors such as revenue, costs, assets and human resources of related parties participating in the transactions and must be compliant with the arm’s length principle.
Under Decree 20, PSM is applied to the following cases:
Taxpayers having integrated related party transactions which are sole, special and closed within the group, carrying out new product development activities, using inclusive technology, participating in group’s inclusive transaction value chain or involving in the entire process of development, enhancement, maintenance, protection and exploitation of exclusive intangible assets without any basis for the determination of the prices between related parties or the transactions are closely related and conducted concurrently, complex financial transactions associated with many global financial markets; 
Taxpayers participating in digital related party transactions without any basis for the determination of the prices between related parties; 
Taxpayers participating in the creation of added values which are received from the synergies of the group; and
Taxpayers performing full-fledge function with regard to the entire business and production process.
This method is applied when actual total profit or projected profit of related party transactions is determined based on financial data of the legal and valid documents; the value and profit of related party transactions should be determined consistently by same accounting methods in the whole period of applying profit split method.
