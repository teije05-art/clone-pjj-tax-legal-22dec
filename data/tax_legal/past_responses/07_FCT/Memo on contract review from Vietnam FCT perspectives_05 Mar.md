Further to our MFE dated 22 February 2022, we are pleased to set out below our comments with regard to the Vietnam foreign withholding tax (“WHT”) implications related to the contractual arrangements between ABC Co., Ltd and Vietnam ABC Co., Ltd for your perusal. 
Background information
ABC Co., Ltd (“ABC”), a company incorporated under laws of Japan, entered into two contractual arrangements with Vietnam ABC Co., Ltd (“V_ABC”) for (i) Technology transfer; and (ii) Sales Commission (collectively referred to as “the Contracts”). 
In this regard, ABC seeks KPMG Vietnam’s assistance by reviewing the Contracts and providing comments on:
the Vietnamese WHT in relation to the payments made by V_ABC to ABC in accordance with the Contracts; and
the possibility for Vietnamese income tax exemption/reduction on ABC’s income from the performance of the Contracts under the Double Taxation Agreement between Vietnam and Japan (“Vietnam – Japan DTA”);
Based on the copies of contract agreements and related supporting documents provided to us and the information discussed with and confirmed by V_ABC, we are pleased to summarise hereunder our understandings and limitation of report for your review and confirmation. For avoidance of doubt, it is critical that you consider these understandings and limitation of report. Please advise if any of our understanding is not correct as it may materially impact our comments herein.  
Our understanding
Technology transfer contract (“TTC”) 
On 1 April 2015, ABC and V_ABC signed the TTC to contractually agree on the following support arrangement and fee charged:


Scope of work and fee charge
Tax related term 
As per Clause 4.3, Article 4 of the TTC, ABC shall bear taxes levied in Vietnam on the set forth fees charged. V_ABC shall withhold such taxes from payables to ABC and pay on behalf of ABC to the tax office. 
Duration of the agreement
As per Article 14 of the Agreement, the TTC shall be effective for a period of five years from the signing date. After that, the two parties may agree to renew the agreement. 
As per Ms. Nhung’s email on 28 February 2022 (i.e. the delegated personnel from V_ABC to cooperate with KPMG on the engagement), the TTC was renewed on 1 April 2020 to extend the effectiveness until 31 March 2023. All terms and conditions under the TTC dated 1 April 2015 are kept unchanged. 
Dispatch of ABC’s engineers to V_ABC
As per our discussion with Ms. Nhung, from time to time ABC may dispatch their engineers to Vietnam to perform the Separate Technical Assistance. However, the number of aggregated residence days of all ABC’s engineers is mostly less than 183 days in a calendar year.  
Current WHT treatments adopted by V_ABC
V_ABC withholds 10% Corporate Income Tax (“CIT”) from all payments made to ABC under the TTC. In addition, V_ABC bears the Value Added Tax (“VAT”) at 5% in relation to such payment; 
Where ABC dispatches their engineers to Vietnam to provide the services and V_ABC has to bear associated costs (e.g. travelling, accommodation, etc.), V_ABC shall add up those payments, including 20% PIT borne by V_ABC on such payments, for WHT calculation at the same rates as aforementioned. 
For the training fee paid to ABC to provide training services in overseas to V_ABC’s engineers, V_ABC did not withhold, declare and pay WHT. 


Agreement on Sales Commission (“ASC”)
On 1 April 2015, ABC and V_ABC signed the ASC to contractually agree on the following support arrangement and fee charged:
Scope of work and fee charge
Tax related term 
As per Clause 3.4, Article 3 of the ASC, ABC shall bear taxes levied in Vietnam on the set forth fees charged. V_ABC shall withhold such taxes from payables to ABC and pay on behalf of ABC to the tax office. 
Duration of the agreement
As per Article 9 of the Agreement, the TTC shall be effective for 01 year from the signing date, except for case of early termination as stipulated under Article 6. After 01 year, the two parties may agree to renew the agreement. 
As per our verbal discussion with Ms. Nhung, we understand that the ASC has been renewed annually with the terms and conditions kept unchanged. 
Dispatch of ABC’s sales staff to V_ABC
As per our discussion with Ms. Nhung, there is no dispatch of ABC’s sales staff to V_ABC during the contract period. 


Current WHT treatments adopted by V_ABC
For the Sales Commission related to export sales: V_ABC does not withhold and declare WHT. As advised by Ms Nhung, V_ABC adopts this treatment following the guidance of Clause 4, Article 2 of Circular 103/2014/TT-BTC; 
For the Sales Commission related to domestic sales: V_ABC withholds 5% CIT and 5% VAT before making the respective payments to ABC. 
Limitations of the report
For purpose of this advice, we have made the following limitations of the scope: 
Our report will focus on the WHT treatments in relation to the above contractual arrangements between VND and ABC. As ABC assigns expatriates to Vietnam to perform services, Personal Income Tax (“PIT”) obligations to ABC’s involved personnel should exist. If requested, we are happy to assist ABC to consider PIT implications under a separate engagement.
Our report will not consider the Vietnam tax implications to V_ABC in relation to the above contractual arrangements with ABC. While we may see certain tax risks for V_ABC in relation to the above contractual arrangement other than the WHT implications that we have mentioned herein, we are happy to assist V_ABC to consider such tax exposures under a separate engagement.
Our comments on taxation herein have been prepared based on the information and documents provided ABC and V_ABC without any independent verification. We take no responsibility for any misstatement of facts or omissions of vital information, which may cause another opinion to be formed. 
Our comments are given in accordance with the relevant regulations currently in force in Vietnam as of the reporting date. The relevant regulatory documents are as outlined in Appendix I.
Executive summary 
Regarding the TTC
V_ABC is declaring WHT for TTC at 10% CIT and 5% VAT, which seems to be compliant with the current regulations and guidance from the competent tax authority; 
Where the value of Individual Technical Assistance can be separated and the assistance is proved to be for daily operation (i.e. not forms an indispensable requirement to the transferred technology), there may be chance for the payment to be subject to 5% CIT and 5% VAT; 
Regarding the ASC
The WHT rates of 5% VAT and 5% CIT that V_ABC adopted in withholding and declaring WHT in relation to the ASC are compliant with the current regulations and guidance from the competent tax authority; 
V_ABC may have under-declared WHT for the service fees related to export sales. 
Possibility of tax relief under the DTA
Double tax treaty would only deal with the CIT element of the WHT. 
No tax exemption or reduction in accordance with the Vietnam – Japan DTA can be applicable to ABC’s income under the TTC.
There is a chance for ABC to enjoy tax exemption in accordance with the Vietnam – Japan DTA with regard to the sale commission derived under the ASC. Of note, tax exemption under the DTA is not automatically granted and official request should be submitted to and approved by the Vietnam tax authority. 
Our comments on the WHT treatments adopted by V_ABC
Assessment of WHT implications to TTC
On the royalties income 
Under Vietnam tax regulations, the WHT shall comprise of two elements: Corporate Income Tax (“CIT”) and Value Added Tax (“VAT”). 
In accordance with Circular 103/2014/TT-BTC, royalties income, which is defined to include income in any forms being paid for the use right, transfers of intellectual property rights and technology transfers, software copyrights transfers (including the amounts paying for rights of use, transfer of author rights and work ownership; the transfer of industrial property rights; technology transfers; software copyrights transfers), shall be subject to 10% CIT. 
From the VAT perspective, as per Official Letter No. 15888/BTC-CST dated 7 November 2016 of the Ministry of Finance (“MoF”), the grant of right to use the trademark is neither considered as franchising activities (which is the regulated subject of the Commerce Law) nor the activity of provision of science and technology services involved in the intellectual property (which is the regulated subject of the Law on Science and Technology). Such activity is governed by the Law on Intellectual Property but it is not the transfer of intellectual property right. The MoF therefore has concluded that the grant of right to use the trademark is subject to VAT, specifically 10% VAT for taxpayer declaring VAT on credit method and 5% for taxpayer declaring tax on deemed method. 
Circular 103 also regulates that in case there are multiple work items within a contract which are subject to different WHT rates but there is no value breakdown for each work item, then the highest WHT rate shall be imposed on total contract value. 
It is stated in the TTC that royalties will be paid by V_ABC to ABC for: 
The non-exclusive right and license to manufacture and sell Licensed Products using technical information of ABC under its technical assistance in Vietnam; 
The Package Technical Assistance; and 
The non-exclusive right to use ABC’s trademark.  
The value of each item is not provided separately in the TTC and in any invoices issued by ABC to V_ABC.
Pertaining to the above regulations and MoF’s guidance, technically, if there is a value breakdown under the underlying contract for all the above items, there may be chance for a WHT rate of 10% CIT – VAT exempt to be applied for items (i) and (ii). The WHT rate of 10% CIT and 5% VAT would only be applied to V_ABC’s payment for item (iii), if any. Of note, for the application of different tax rates as we mentioned, the value breakdown should be made consistently in other supporting documents such as invoices and relevant payment documents between the two parties.
However, since there is no value breakdown available, V_ABC has applied the highest tax rate of 10% CIT – 5% VAT on total royalties payments to ABC, which is in line with the prevailing regulations. We understand that V_ABC has obtained an official guidance from the Hanoi Tax Department (“HNTD”), which is consistent with the treatment adopted by V_ABC. We agree with this treatment and have no further comment in this regard. 
On the payment for individual / separate technical assistance and surplus expenses of dispatched engineers in Vietnam 
The current regulations on taxation do not have clear guidance on how to determine royalties income. However, from our practical observation and unofficial consultation on a no name basis with the General Department of Taxation and local tax departments, we note that:
if the technical assistance forms an indispensable portion to the transferred technology/technical information/manual, which is compulsorily required for the complete transfer of the underlying technology following the timeline of technology transfer, the related payments may be considered to be of the same nature with the technology transfer for WHT determination purposes. 
If the technical assistance is for daily operation support and manufacturing support (i.e. not form an indispensable portion to the transferred technology), the payment thereof should be considered as of general service nature, which is subject to WHT of 5% CIT and 5% VAT. 
Of note, WHT should also be imposed on any costs incurred by V_ABC in Vietnam on behalf of ABC, including the PIT liability of expatriates assigned by ABC to V_ABC to perform services.
Since V_ABC has applied the WHT rates of 10% CIT and 5% VAT on total contract value, V_ABC may have over withheld WHT from payments made to ABC if the individual technical assistance is of general business support nature. 
On the payment for training service provided to V_ABC’s engineers in overseas
Under the current regulations, training service performed in overseas (except for the online training) is not subject to WHT in Vietnam. 
Given that V_ABC has complied with this guidance and treated the income paid to ABC as WHT-exempt, we agree and have no further exception noted. 
Discrepancy between the contractual tax term and the actual withholding practice
As contractually, ABC should be the party to bear any Vietnamese WHT triggered from the TTC. In consideration of the current practice adopted by V_ABC, whereby V_ABC only withholds the CIT portion of WHT from the payments made to ABC and bears the VAT portion of WHT, there might be a risk that the tax authorities would deem that the VAT portion is actually the income of ABC, hence will seek to recalculate and deem additional WHT liability of ABC accordingly. 
Commercially, V_ABC may collect such VAT portion from ABC if there is no amendment of the tax related term. 
Of note, technically in any case, the VAT portion of WHT should be creditable to V_ABC, hence becomes cost neutral. Given this, where appropriate, a net-of-VAT scheme under the TTC should benefit both V_ABC and ABC, subject to the amendment of the current tax clause. 

Assessment of WHT implications to ASC
On the applicable WHT rates
Under the current regulations, income from general service provision is subject to WHT rates at 5% VAT and 5% CIT. 
Circular 103 also regulates on cases not subject to WHT, including brokerage for sale of goods, provision of services to overseas.
Currently, V_ABC is withholding WHT from payments made to ABC (both CIT and VAT elements – consistent with the contractual tax term) based on the sales classification: No WHT if the charge is related to export sale while 5% CIT and 5% VAT will be withheld if the charge is related to domestic sales. 
As clarified by Ms. Nhung, the support from ABC may include both the sale commission (applicable when ABC successfully introduces new buyers to V_ABC) and other general sales support as per Article 2 of the ASC. Pertaining to this, there is a high risk that if the export sales is not generated from new buyers introduced by ABC, the relevant charge should not qualified for WHT exemption. Rather, it should be subject to WHT at 5% CIT and 5% VAT technically. In this case, it is highly likely that V_ABC has under withheld WHT on the payments made to ABC. 
Possibility of applying tax relief under Vietnam – Japan DTA
Notwithstanding the above FCT analysis, under the domestic regulations, where Vietnam enters into an international treaty or agreement, such as an Agreement on Avoidance of Double Taxation (“DTA”), which contains a tax provision that differs from the contents stipulated in the domestic regulations, the provisions of such international treaty or agreement shall prevail. Accordingly, in the case of ABC, as a resident of Japan, tax provisions provided under the Vietnam - Japan DTA will be referred to for purposes of tax relief consideration.
Generally, the DTA enables business organizations or individuals to access relief from double taxation to direct taxes, including but not limited to CIT, PIT, etc., either by way of (i) tax credit; or (ii) tax exemption; or (iii) reduced withholding tax rates. 
For the purpose of this memo, we only consider the possibility of tax exemption/reduction in Vietnam under the Vietnam – Japan DTA for ABC’s consideration.
Regarding the royalties and technical assistance income under the TTC
It is stated under Article 12 of the Vietnam – Japan DTA that: 
“1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State.
2. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise and according to the laws of that Contracting State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the royalties the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties”.
Pertaining to this, Vietnam is allowed to tax the royalties income, but not exceed 10% of the gross amount of the royalties. 
Nevertheless, since the royalties income is subject to 10% CIT under Vietnam domestic laws, the provision of DTA cannot help to reduce the tax payable of ABC in this case.
Of further note, in case V_ABC and ABC can separately determine ABC’s income from provision of normal technical service to V_ABC, which is subject to WHT rate of 5% VAT and 5% CIT applicable to services, Article 7 - Business profits of Vietnam – Japan DTA can be referred to in determining the possibility for ABC’ exemption of WHT (CIT portion). 
It is stipulated under Article 7 of Vietnam – Japan DTA that: 
“1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that Contracting State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other Contracting State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment".
With regard to the determination of permanent establishment (“PE”), it is provided under Clause 4, Article 5 of the Vietnam – Japan DTA that: 
“4. An enterprise of a Contracting State shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State if it furnishes in that other Contracting State, services including consultancy services through employees or other personnel provided that such activities last (for the same project or two or more connected projects) for a period or periods aggregating more than six months within any twelve-month period”.
Since the duration of the TTC has been more than 12 months and ABC have been assigning expatriates to work in Vietnam to support V_ABC, ABC is deemed to have a PE in Vietnam, and hence is not qualified for DTA exemption under the Vietnam – Japan DTA on the income derived from the TTC.   
Regarding the business income under the ASC
The payment for the sale commission provided by ABC to V_ABC is considered as business income and therefore, governed by Article 7 of the Vietnam – Japan DTA. Accordingly, there may be chance for ABC to apply exemption of CIT portion of WHT payable in Vietnam if ABC provides the sales commission services to V_ABC not via a PE in Vietnam or the services do not constitute a PE of ABC in Vietnam and ABC can successfully defense such position with the local tax authority. 
As we have analysed above, ABC’s PE status in relation to the ASC should be determined based on whether (i) ABC assigns employees or engages any person in Vietnam to perform services to V_ABC; AND (ii) the ASC lasts for more than six months in a twelve-month period.
As confirmed by V_ABC, ABC has not assigned employees or engaged any person in Vietnam to perform services at V_ABC. Given this, it may be considered that a PE is not constituted for ABC in Vietnam in relation to the performance of the ASC. 
Of note, tax exemption is not automatically granted and a DTA notification dossier should be submitted to the Vietnam tax authority. Upon receipt of the full dossier, the tax authorities will issue a written notice on whether or not the taxpayer is eligible for tax relief under the DTA within 30 days or 40 days (in case a further investigation is required to have a clear basis for the notice). 
In addition, the statutory limit for DTA application is three years only, calculating from the date when the related tax liability arises. Any DTA tax exemption/tax refund application exceeding the statutory limit will be disallowed under the Vietnamese regulations.
Notwithstanding the above, we would like to note that V_ABC has two contracts with ABC at the same time (i.e. TTC and ASC) and ABC assigns employees to Vietnam from time to time to perform services in relation to the TTC. This practice may trigger the local tax authority’s interpretation and challenge that the assignees from ABC may be working in Vietnam for the purposes of both TTC and ASC. Hence, in case V_ABC cannot provide proper and justifiable explanation and evidence demonstrating the purposes and time spent by ABC’s assignees just for the TTC only, the tax authority may disallow the DTA exemption for ABC accordingly.
All in all, we note that the local tax authority’s acceptance of the Company’s tax exemption would greatly depend on ABC’s provided supporting documents and proper explanation.
