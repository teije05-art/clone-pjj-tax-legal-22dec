PE vs FCT - Practical perspective
The practice so far has indicated that the Vietnamese tax authorities have rarely requested foreign companies to pay CIT based on the PE concept (i.e. identifying the income attributable to and the expenses allocated to the PE in Vietnam to arrive at the actual net profits). The reason could be that the Vietnamese tax authorities do not want to be involved in the lengthy tax inspection to assess which expenses allocated from overseas to the PE in Vietnam are deductible, etc.
Instead, the tax authorities prefer taxing foreign companies via the FCT regime. The FCT system generally allows the Vietnamese tax authorities to assess tax on foreign companies on a deemed basis without going into details, such as deductible expenses, a PE exists or not, etc.
In practice the PE concept is usually only referred to when the foreign companies wish to prove that they do not have a PE in Vietnam and claim for CIT exemption under the respective DTA.
In light of the above, though the foreign EPC contractor’s activities constitute PE in Vietnam, it is unlikely that foreign EPC contractor will pay tax under the PE regime. Instead FCT will apply in the foreign EPC contractor’s case.
