We refer to the EL dated 6 December 2021 between KPMG Tax and Advisory Limited (“KPMG”) and A. In this regard, we would like to set out below comments for your perusal.
Background information
Based on information provided to us, we are pleased to summarise hereunder our understandings, assumptions and limitation of report for your review and confirmation. For avoidance of doubt, it is critical that you consider these understandings, assumptions and limitation of report. Please advise if any of our understanding/assumptions is not correct as it may materially impact our comments herein. 
Our understanding
B being established and operating under the laws of Sweden, and A, the affiliate of B in X Group stablished under the laws of Vietnam, have form a consortium (“the Consortium”) to jointly enter into Contract No.X for package “Supply radio system equipment” (“the Contract”).
From the documents provided and information confirmed by B, we understand that:
Contracting parties under the Contract : 
C (“C…” or “the Buyer”), a company established under the laws of Vietnam, who is authorised by the End-User to sign the Contract and arrange the importation procedures, customs clearance for the equipment imported into Vietnam and other obligations as specified under the Contract;
V (“V…” or “the End-user”), being the Project Owner, who authorizes the Buyer to sign the Contract and conduct the customs clearance, the importation procedures as well as other obligations as specified under the Contract;
The Consortium (comprising B and A) in the capacity of the Seller(s). 
Arrangement of the scope of work:
The Sellers shall supply the equipment and services as referred to in the Annex I ­ Price List of the Contract, whereby the scope of work is separately indicated as follows: 
B undertakes and assumes sole responsibility for the Foreign Portion (i.e. pure supply of Hardware, Software and Software right to use) on the basis of DAP Vietnam seaport/airport; and
A undertakes and assumes sole responsibility for the Local Portion (i.e. locally purchased Hardware and Services in relation to the supplied hardware and software). All the technical support, installation and other services are entirely under A’s scope of work. 
Contract Price: 
Contract Price is determined as the total value of works undertaken by B and A;
The contract value corresponding to the scope of work of each Seller is clearly indicated in the Annex I ­ Price List of the Contract.
Invoicing and payment: 
Invoices are issued separately by B to the Buyer for B’s own scope of work; and 
Payments are made by the Buyer separately to B’s designated account for B’s invoiced amounts.
Vietnamese tax related terms: 
The Corporate Income Tax (“CIT”) portion of Vietnamese Foreign Contractor Tax (“FCT”) is determined in advance for B’s work portion under the Contract and factored in the Contract Price while the Value Added Tax (“VAT”) portion of FCT is assumed by the Buyer, hence exclusive from the Contract Price. 
The Buyer assumes the responsibility to pay the Vietnamese FCT on B's behalf to the Vietnamese Tax Authorities. 
In this regard, B seeks KPMG Vietnam’s assistance by providing: 
comments on the Vietnamese FCT implications in relation to the payments made by the Buyer to B in accordance with the Contract; 
recommendations to mitigate the tax risks, if any; 
comments on the possibility for Vietnamese income tax exemption/reduction on the Buyer’s payments made to B under the Double Taxation Agreement between Vietnam and Sweden (“Vietnam – Sweden DTA” or “DTA”);
recommendation of contract wordings for the purpose of applying DTA (where applicable).
Our assumptions and limitations of the report 
For purpose of this advice, we have made the following assumptions and limitations of the scope: 
B does not conduct any business activities in the territory of Vietnam nor does it have a fixed place in Vietnam; 
The arrangement under the Contract has been fixed and will not be changed;
In no cases, B will have/engage staff working in Vietnam or assign experts to A or exercise any actions to support A during A’s implementation of the Contract; and
Our report will not consider the Vietnam tax obligations on A in relation to A’s jointly performing the Contract with B.
Our comments on taxation have been prepared based on the information and documents provided you, in accordance with the relevant regulations currently in force in Vietnam as of the reporting date. Our comments are mainly based on the legal documents as outlined in Appendix 1.
Our comments
Foreign Contractor Tax (“FCT”) implications 
FCT is a tax collection regime that applies to, amongst others, foreign business organizations, with or without permanent establishment in Vietnam doing business in Vietnam or having Vietnam-sourced income on the basis of a contract, agreement or undertaking between such foreign contractors and Vietnamese organizations or individuals. FCT includes VAT and CIT portions. 
FCT obligations in Vietnam 
Conceptually, FCT will not be applied if the goods are supplied with the place of delivery and the ownership of the goods are transferred to the Vietnamese buyer at the border gates, and without accompanied services provided in Vietnam. 
Per our practical observation, B as a member of a Consortium should have joint responsibilities for the implementation of the Project, and the ownership of the goods supplied by B should only be transferred to the Buyer upon the Buyer’s acceptance and hand-over of the respective portion of the Project. As such, B would be considered as having goods transferred within Vietnam territory. On such basis, FCT is highly likely imposed on B’s income from supplying of hardware.
With regards to the payment made by the Buyer to B for software/software right to use under the Contract, it will be subject to Vietnamese FCT.
Applicable FCT rates
FCT is applied at various rates, depending on the nature of the payment. Under the regulation and based on the scope of work and price list of the Contract which separately indicate the value of hardware, software and software right to use, the deemed rate applicable for B income under the Contract are as below:
B’s income from pure supply of hardware and spare parts is subject to 1% CIT and not subject to VAT. 
B’s income from software and software right to use is considered as royalty income, which is subject to 10% CIT and VAT exempt.
FCT calculation
Under the tax term of the Contract, i.e. Clause 24, the Buyer shall declare and pay FCT on B's behalf to the Vietnamese Tax Authorities. Given this, it is understood that B has opt to adopt the Deemed Withholding Method for FCT purposes. FCT will be calculated on a deemed basis, by applying the respective deemed CIT and VAT rates to the contract gross turnover.
Based on the Price summary of Annex 1 attached to the Contract, we have reviewed the CIT portion of FCT amount on equipment value and software/software right to use stated therein, and have no comment in this regard. 
Note on FCT declaration of B as a Consortium member
Given the scope of work of each Consortium member (i.e. B/A) is clearly and separately defined under the Contract and the corresponding revenue of each member is separated in the contract price, BOQ and invoices, technically, B is allowed to adopt a method for FCT declaration at the Company’s discretion for its own revenue portion. As such, the deemed withholding method adopted by B for its FCT declaration as agreed in the Contract should be acceptable.
Notwithstanding the above, we note that the above principle for FCT declaration is based on the stipulation under Circular 156/2013/TT-BTC on tax administration (“Circular 156”). Circular 156, however, has been replaced by the newly issued Circular 80/2021/TT-BTC effective from 1 January 2022 (“Circular 80”), which is silent on FCT declaration of foreign party as a member of Consortium formed with a Vietnamese company. Per our unofficial discussion with the tax authority, the principle for FCT declaration under Circular 156 might still be applied, however, for prudent, B is recommended to seek an official confirmation of the tax managing authority on separate FCT declaration in this regard as it may materially impact B’s FCT as well as tax exemption position. 
Our comments hereunder on the possibility of enjoying tax relief under the DTA are provided on the assumption that B is satisfied for declaring tax separately of the Consortium member.
Possibility of tax relief under the Vietnam- Sweden DTA
Notwithstanding the above, when Vietnam enters into an international tax treaty or agreement which contains provisions on tax payment by foreign organisations which differ from the contents stipulated in current domestic tax laws, the provisions of such international treaty or agreement shall prevail. Accordingly, in the case of B, as a resident of Sweden, tax provisions provided under the Vietnam- Sweden DTA will be referred to for purposes of tax relief consideration.
In particular, B, in the capacity of a Seller under the Contract, may have the opportunity to enjoy tax relief under the Vietnam – Sweden DTA in either of the following schemes, where appropriate:
- Scheme 1: CIT (of FCT) exemption/reduction in Vietnam, subject to the simultaneous satisfaction of the conditions stated the Vietnam – Sweden DTA; or
- Scheme 2: Credit of CIT (of FCT) liability paid in Vietnam against tax liability paid in Sweden.
Tax exemption/reduction under the Vietnam – Sweden DTA
B’s income from supply of hardware and spare parts
The payment for the hardware/spare parts supplied by B to the Buyer is considered as business income and therefore, governed by Article 7-Business profits of the Vietnam – Sweden DTA. 
Paragraph 1, Article 7 of the Vietnam – Sweden DTA on taxing of business profit, states that, 
“The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.”
As such, tax exemption in Vietnam can be applied if B does not constitute a permanent establishment (“PE”) in Vietnam, and can successfully defense such position with the local tax authority. Of note, tax exemption is not automatically granted and official request should be submitted to the Vietnam tax authority (please refer to Appendix 2). 
PE considerations 
Under the applicable domestic regulations, PE means a business establishment through which a foreign organisation conducts all or a part of its business activities in Vietnam which earn income.
Under Article 5 of the Vietnam-Sweden DTA, a PE is broadly defined as “a fixed place of business through which the business of the enterprise is wholly or partly carried on”.
All in all, both the DTA and the domestic regulation seems to agree that in case an enterprise carries out wholly or partial of business activities through a fixed place in Vietnam, the enterprise will be deemed as constituting a PE in Vietnam.
Pursuant to the Contract and B’s confirmation, it is understood that: 
B has no physical presence in Vietnam; and 
B purely supplies hardware and software/the right to use software in Vietnam. All the technical support, installation and other services are under A’s scope of work. B will not be involved in any works performed in Vietnam and B’s staff shall not be assigned to Vietnam to support for implementation of A’s scope of work. 
Given the above, it can be considered that a PE is not constituted for B in Vietnam in relation to the performance of the Contract. 
Notwithstanding the above, from the provided documents, we noted that per the Teaming Agreement dated 11 October 2021 between B and A (“Teaming Agreement”), A assumes the role of the lead member who represent the Consortium to, amongst others, (i) sign the Letter of Bid; and (ii) sign letters and documents to contract with the project owner during participation of procurement process including letter of request for clarification of bidding documents and bids explanation and clarification letter of bid, sign request for bid withdrawal, modification and substitutions.
We note that the applicable law on Corporate Income Tax also contains a specific definition of PE, according to which, a PE of an overseas entity may take the following forms, amongst others:
“……
e) a representative in Vietnam in the following cases:
- where it has authority to enter into contracts in the name of a company overseas;
- where it is not competent to enter into contracts in the name of a foreign company but regularly delivers goods or provides services in Vietnam.”
In addition, Circular 205/2013/TT-BTC guiding the implementation of DTAs also provides guidance that a foreign entity will be considered as constituting a PE in Vietnam in case it give authorisation to a Vietnamese party to habitually negotiate and conclude contracts in the name of the foreign party; or the foreign party concludes contracts in his name but bind obligations and duties of that Vietnamese party. 
While the term “habitually” is not specifically defined in Circular 205 as well as in any other taxation regulations, we note from our practical observation that during the consideration of a DTA exemption application, the tax authority would be focusing more on the contract performance process in determining if a PE is constituted for the foreign party; nevertheless, if they notice any documents demonstrating that any Vietnamese person is authorised to act on behalf of the foreign party in the contract negotiation process, the DTA application would be challenged and rejected accordingly on the argument that the contract has been concluded through a PE of the foreign party in Vietnam. 
Pertaining to the above, the fact that B and A agreed in the Teaming Agreement that A will represent the Consortium (meaning that A will represent B) during the bidding stage by signing the Letter of Bid, and signing letters and documents to contract with Procuring Entity during participation of procurement process might trigger the interpretation that A is authorised by B, to some extents, to negotiate the Contract on behalf of B, hence there is a high risk that B would be considered as having a PE constituted in Vietnam.
Notwithstanding this, as B did authorise its own representatives to participate in the negotation and finalisation of the contract, while both the CIT regulations and Circular 205 only provide that the authorisation to a Vietnamese person to negotiate and sign contract on the foreign party’s behalf can be deemed to constitute a PE, B may argue that the scope of B’s authorisation to A did not cover the contract negotitation and signing on B’s behalf, as such should not fall under the scope of PE definition under CIT regulation and Circular 205. This, however, should be subject to the local tax authority’s assessment and acceptance. For prudence, B should consider seeking an official confirmation from the Vietnamese competent tax authorities for proper implementation. If requested, we are happy to assist the Company with a ruling service in this regard. 
Conclusion
On the basis that a PE may be deemed to be constituted for B in Vietnam in relation to B’s authorisation given to A during the bidding process, the possibility for B’s applying for income tax exemption in Vietnam under the Vietnam – Sweden DTA might become unlikely (i.e. B’s income from supply of hardware and spare parts will be taxed in Vietnam in accordance with the FCT regulations). 
In case B decides to and can successfully defend its non-PE position with the local tax authority by demonstrating that B did not authorise A to negotiate the Contract, the Company may apply for tax exemption under the Vietnam – Sweden DTA. The administrative procedure for applying the tax exemption under DTA is presented under Appendix 2 hereto for ease of reference.
B’s income from provision of software, software right to use
Royalty income from software provision 
Under Article 12 of the Vietnam- Sweden DTA, royalties are defined as “payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work including cinematograph films, or films or tapes used for radio or television broadcasting, any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience.”
Under the 2008 Commentary to Article 12 in the OECD Model Tax Treaty, para 13.1, 14 and 14.4 describes the type of software transaction. Which in summary, if the payment merely constitutes a consideration for a copy of the software necessary to enable the end user to operate a program, the payment shall be classified as business profits. On the other hand, if the payment gives the customer a right to exploit the intellectual right in the software, the payment shall be classified as royalties. Such right to exploit would include for example the right to copy and distribute or reproduce and make the software available to the public.
Circular 205, guiding the implementation of the Double Tax Agreement, clearly stipulates that royalties mean amounts paid for the use of or the right to use software. 
Pertaining to OECD rules, B’s income from software provision to customer for using with clear restriction on copyright and modification might not be classified as royalties. However, as Vietnam is not an OECD member, OECD rules have not been legally effective in Vietnam. Therefore, as the Vietnam – Sweden DTA does not have specific provision defining that the use of or the right to use software is treated as business income rather than royalties, then domestic regulations will be applied.
As our observation in practice, Vietnam tax authorities follow above-mentioned domestic regulations i.e. Circular 205 (which clearly states that royalties include payments for the use of or the right to use software) in defining royalties for FCT declaration and applying DTA purposes. Based on both domestic regulations and observations from practical tax cases in relation to software provision, it could be concluded that B’s provision of the right to use software under the Contract is classified as royalties, and are governed by Article 12 of the Vietnam- Sweden DTA.
Possibility of tax relief under the DTA 
Article 12 of the Vietnam- Sweden DTA provides that:
royalty income may be taxed in the country in which the income arises at a tax rate not exceeding 15% of the gross amount of the royalty, which is not lower than those stipulated under the Vietnam regulations.
if the royalties are paid with respect to any patent, design or model, secret formula or process, or for information concerning industrial or scientific experience or for the use of or the right to use industrial, commercial or scientific equipment involving a transfer of know how, the tax so charged shall not exceed 5% of the gross amount of the royalty. However, this reduction of tax rate is not applicable to royalty income from software provision. 
With that said, no tax reduction is available under the Vietnam- Sweden DTA for B’s income from provision of software, software right to use (i.e. B will be subject to FCT in accordance with the Vietnamese regulations at 10% CIT).
Tax credit under the Vietnam – Sweden DTA
Article 22 of the DTA between Vietnam and Australia provides methods for the elimination of double taxation, i.e. “Where a resident of Sweden derives income which under the laws of Vietnam and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement may be taxed in Vietnam, Sweden shall allow - subject to the provisions of the law of Sweden concerning credit for foreign tax (as it may be amended from time to time without changing the general principle hereof) - as a deduction from the tax on such income, an amount equal to the Vietnamese tax paid in respect of such income.”.
That said, if B’s business income and royalty income is subject to tax in Sweden, B may seek to claim a foreign tax credit in Sweden for FCT paid in Vietnam, provided that tax payment in Vietnam is in accordance with the laws of Vietnam and the Vietnam – Sweden DTA. B may refer to the Sweden regulations on the documents required and procedures to apply for a tax credit in Sweden, where appropriate. 
Recommendations for strenthening the FCT position
Notwithstanding the above, we note that from our practical observation of similar cases where machineries, software are supplied by a foreign party while the installation finish and technical assistance in relation to such machineries, software are performed by a Vietnamese party, the local tax authority may challenge the capability of the foreign party in general on the installation and technical assistance portion whereby the foreign supply for most of the project are mainly the complicated set of equipment system and logically requires the involvement in the installation/ technical assistance of the foreign supplier. Hence, in case the tax authority finds out any services carried out locally by the foreign supplier (i.e. B) by way of assigning experts or conducting any supporting actions to the Vietnamese consortium member (i.e. A), they may consider that B and A cannot separate their work portions under the Contract, hence would challenge and reject B’s method of FCT declaration, which would alter the FCT rates as determined for B’s work portion in the Contract accordingly.
All in all, we note that the local tax authority’s acceptance of the Company’s position as mentioned above would greatly depend on the Company’s provided supporting documents and proper explanation. In order to mitigate such risk, it is recommended that: 
B and A should maintain the evidences showing that A is well capable to perform their own scope of work without the involvement and support of B;
There should be no provision in the Contract or any related documents specifically indicate/require that the Buyer must engage A to perform the installation/technical support in relation to the hardware and software supplied by B; and 
There should be no wordings/provision in the Contract or in any related documents specifically requiring that the installation/technical support in relation to the hardware and software supplied by B must be supervised by Sweden experts or any experts appointed by B. 
In addition, the Consortium agreement and the Contract must have provisions clearly demonstrating that:
B and A form a consortium to jointly perform the Contract with the approach that each party will be responsible for their own scope of work, which will be separately performed by each party;
Both parties sign the Contract with the Buyer and each party will be severally and separately responsible for its own scope of work under the Contract;
Invoices to be issued separately by each party for their own scope of work performed;
Payments to be made by the Buyer separately to each party; and
No involvement of each party to the other’s scope of work.    
Further, other supporting documents such as separate invoices issued by B to the Buyer, payment vouchers evidencing the Buyer’s payment made separately to B, etc. must be available to present to the local tax authority, if required.

Appendix 2: Administrative procedure to affect the tax exemption under the DTA in Vietnam 
Under the current Vietnamese regulations, the tax exemption under the DTA is not automatically applied. 
For tax exemption purpose, the taxpayer is required to submit a DTA application dossier to request for tax exemption to the local tax authority (“DTA tax exemption application”).  
Where the taxpayer is eligible for tax exemption under DTA but has already paid tax liabilities to the local tax authority, they are entitled to tax refund, subject to submission of DTA application dossier for tax refund to the local tax authority (“DTA tax refund application”).
For DTA tax exemption application, the tax authorities will issue a written notice on whether or not the taxpayer is eligible for tax relief under the DTA within 30 days or 40 days (in case a further investigation is required to have a clear basis for the notice) from the date of receipt of the notification dossier.
The first DTA tax refund application for each contract is subject to tax audit for refund purposes. 
The timeline and required documents for submission of DTA tax exemption/ tax refund application is regulated as follows:
For DTA tax exemption application: Under the current regulation, the DTA tax exemption application is required to be submitted to the local tax authority within 15 days before FCT declaration deadline, which is within 10 days from the income payment date or within 20 days of the following month in case the Vietnamese tax payer applies for monthly FCT filing. The application dossier consists of:
The Request for tax exemption or reduction (form 01/HTQT enclosed with Circular 80);
The original or certified true copy of the Certificate of residence (consularly legalized) issued by the tax authority of the home country before the year in which the Notice of eligibility for tax exemption or reduction is issued;
A photocopy of the contract with the Vietnamese entity, which is certified by the taxpayer.
The Letter of attorney if the taxpayer authorizes a legal representative to carry out the procedure for applying the Agreement.
If a request for tax exemption or reduction has been sent in the previous year, only the photocopies of new contracts with Vietnamese parties shall be submitted.
For DTA tax refund application: the tax payer shall submit the application dossier to the local tax the local tax authority where tax was overpaid. The application dossier includes:  
A written request for tax refund according to a Double taxation agreement (form 02/DNHT enclosed herewith).
The original copy (or certified true copy) of the consularly legalized Certificate of residence issued by a tax authority of the home country, specifying the tax year.
Photocopies of business contracts with the Vietnamese entity, that are certified by the taxpayer.
Certification of the operation period and performance according to the contract by the Vietnamese party.
A letter of attorney if the taxpayer authorizes a legal representative to follow the procedure. If the taxpayer authorizes a legal representative to claim tax refund that is transferred to the account of another entity, consular legalization (if the authorization is made overseas) or notarization (if the authorization is made in Vietnam) is required.
A list of tax payment receipts according to form No. 02-1/HT issued together with Circular 80.
In addition to the above, Circular 205/2013/TT-BTC dated 24 December 2013 of the Ministry of Finance providing guidance on the implementation of the DTA between Vietnam and other countries/territories (“Circular 205”) also provides principles for DTA implementation, which include the statutory limit for DTA application, as follows:
“Article 6. Some cases of refusal for application of DTAs on the basis of the principle of DTA beneficial right
Unless otherwise provided in DTA on limitation of DTA beneficial right, the Vietnamese taxation agencies shall refuse the DTA application in the following cases:
1. The applicant wishes to apply the DTA for a tax liability which has arisen more than three years before the request time for DTA application.
That said, the statutory limit for DTA application is three years only, calculating from the date when the related tax liability arises. Any DTA tax exemption/tax refund application exceeding the statutory limit will be disallowed under the Vietnamese regulations.
