Limitations of the report
For purpose of this advice, we have made the following limitations of the scope: 
Our comments on taxation herein have been prepared based on the information and documents provided ABC (VN) without any independent verification. We take no responsibility for any misstatement of facts or omissions of vital information, which may cause another opinion to be formed. 
Our scope of comment under this memo is to cover the withholding tax (“WHT”) implications to ABC (SG) and any Corporate Income Tax (“CIT”) implications to ABC (VN). 
Our comments are given in accordance with the relevant tax regulations currently in force in Vietnam as of the reporting date. 
Our comments
Recent challenge from Vietnam State Auditor (“the SA”) to the same contractual arrangement between ABC (SG) and ABC (VN)
In November 2021, the SA carried out an audit at Ho Chi Minh Tax Department and subsequently challenged the WHT obligations of the same contractual arrangement between ABC (SG) and ABC (VN) mostly on the reasons that:
ABC (SG) distributed goods to Vietnam and at the same time carried out the marketing activities of such goods via ABC (VN); 
ABC (SG) provided financial support to ABC (VN) in association with the goods distribution. 
The SA referred to the provision of Clause 3, Article 1, Circular 103/2014/TT-BTC, which stipulates the subjects of application of WHT in Vietnam to support their interpretation:
“Article 1. Subjects of application
...
3. Any foreign entity that performs the whole or part of goods distribution or service provision in Vietnam, who is still the owner of goods that are delivered to Vietnamese organizations or take responsibility for the cost of distribution, advertising, marketing, quality of goods/services delivered to Vietnamese organizations, or impose prices (including the cases in which the foreign entity authorities or hires some Vietnamese organization to perform part of the distribution or service provision pertaining to goods sale in Vietnam).”
Though ABC (VN) provided an explanation letter to the SA and it seems that the SA agreed with the explanation (i.e. so far both the SA and Ho Chi Minh Tax Department have not challenged ABC (VN) on the issue so far), there are certain provisions of the current arrangement which may trigger the concern from the tax authorities on the involvement of ABC (SG) during the goods distribution in Vietnam, and subsequently would trigger their challenge on WHT.
Scoping and contractual obligations of ABC (VN) under the agreement
It was repeatedly regulated under the agreement that ABC (VN) is responsible to import, promote, market, package, distribute and/or sell where necessary the products in Vietnam (Article 2, Article 3). 
Further, Clause 3.2 of Article 3 also requested ABC (VN) to “promote, market, package, distribute and sell the products only in accordance and consistent with the policies and strategies communicated to ABC (VN) by ABC (SG)”. Clause 3.3 of the same article states that “ABC (SG), on a regular basis, shall provide Distributor with relevant technical, scientific, commercial, regulatory and promotional information as well as promotional policies and strategies relating to the products that are necessary to, or as reasonably requested by Distributor for carrying out its obligations under the Agreement”. 
In the Explanation Letter that ABC (VN) submitted to the SA in December 2021, it was confirmed that “ABC (VN) does not carry out authorized advertising activities on behalf of ABC (SG)” and “ABC (VN) purchased the pharmaceutical products from ABC (SG) and distributed to Vietnam market under our own discretion”. The “promotional policies and strategies”, as verbally advised by Mr. Duc to the SA, is indeed the guidance for usage of the products due to the typical nature of pharmaceuticals. The contents and details of promotion must fully comply with the uses, recommendations, instructions, and specifications of the drug manufacturer. Medicine-trading enterprises are not allowed to advertise differently, misrepresent the uses, indications and recommendations for each medicine. For further clarity, ABC (VN) should consider reflecting the above facts and making a clear statement on the requirement of promotion and marketing that ABC (VN) needs to adhere with.
Nevertheless, the current wordings and contractual scoping of the Agreement may lead to an impression and possible interpretation that the promotion and marketing activities of the products carried out by ABC (VN) are under the regular guidance and control of ABC (SG). The tax authorities therefore may deem that ABC (SG) actually still takes ownership and controllership of the goods distribution and goods promotion and marketing in Vietnam by engaging and instructing ABC (VN) to do so. 
To avoid such an adverse interpretation of the tax authorities, the contractual scoping of ABC (VN) should be specifically limited at “distribution” of ABC (SG)’s products in Vietnam territory only. 
Where possible and only for the purpose of lessening the WHT risk, it is recommended to remove the scope of “promote, market and package”, including the “policies and strategies communicated by ABC (SG)” from current contractual obligations of ABC (VN). 
It should also be made clear under the Agreement that ABC (VN) has its own discretion in performing any marketing/promotion activities and not under any control of ABC (SG) or any overseas entities. 
The delivery term vs. responsibility to bear import costs
It is regulated under the Agreement that the products shall be imported under CIP (Carriage and Insurance Paid to) Incoterm 2010. 
As per Incoterm 2010, CIP term means the seller delivers the goods to the carrier at an agreed place and that the seller must contract for and pay the costs of carriage necessary to bring the goods to the named place of destination. The seller also contracts for insurance cover against the buyer’s risk of loss of or damage to the goods during the carriage. 
As such, if the parties agreed to apply CIP term for the Agreement, then the seller – ABC (SG) – should bear the shipping, insurance, packing costs until the goods are delivered to given place of destination only, rather than covering for all these related expenses without any cut-off point as stated under Clause 5.2, Article 5 of the Agreement. The current unclear term of the Agreement may trigger the confusion in which ABC (SG) still bears the costs even when the goods are delivered and circulated in Vietnam’s territory, which further leads to WHT risk for ABC (SG) accordingly.
To avoid the risk where the tax authorities, the cut-off point for ABC (SG) to borne freight, insurance and shipping expenses should be made to Clause 5.2 of Article 5, and Clause 9.2 (b), Article 9 as well. 
On the requirement of reporting of the unit sales
Per Clause 3.5 of Article 3, ABC (VN) is required to inform ABC (SG) with respect to each calendar month of the aggregate of products sold in units and of the net sales as well as prevailing market conditions concerning the products. 
We noted that the SA did raise their concern on this requirement and ABC (VN) explained the reasons of reporting is for production and inventory forecast. Nevertheless, Article 5.1 of Article 5 has regulated the same on forecasting, stock management, ordering and delivery, which is handled in accordance with group procedures. 
Theoretically, once the risk and rewards of the goods’ ownership have been totally passed to ABC (VN), ABC (VN)’s business result including the sales report should not be related to ABC (SG). With the sales reporting requirement, the tax authorities may consider that ABC (SG) has direct controllership over ABC (VN)’s sale activities in Vietnam and thus, should be deemed for WHT as per regulated under Clause 3, Article 1 Circular 103.
The parties should consider removing this term under Clause 3.5, or combine it to Clause 5.1 to be in the form of mutual information sharing mechanism between contractual parties, in which ABC (SG) – with sole purpose of understanding the overseas market demand so that they can review and adjust its production plan – may ask ABC (VN) to share the sales report in a certain time for further market research.
On the warranty related to Quality Control
In accordance with Circular 103, imported goods accompanied with services performed in Vietnam, such as installation, trial run, warranty, maintenance and other services, will be taxed in Vietnam. Where separable, 1% CIT – VAT exempt will be applied for goods portion and 5% VAT – 5% CIT will be for services portion, otherwise, 2% CIT will be imposed on the total contract value. For warranty, only the case where warranty term is integrated in the contract as seller’s obligation and more importantly, the overseas entity does not provide any services in Vietnam, then the transaction might not subject to WHT.
Pertaining the Company’s case, if ABC (SG) shall be responsible for the removal and replacement of any non-conforming products from ABC (VN)’s facilities, it should be clear on whether:
ABC (SG) will be directly in charge of removal/replacement works and other warranty-related works at any stores/facilities in Vietnam that have unqualified products; or,
ABC (SG) will only receive the goods returned as well as send replacement to ABC (VN), without doing any services in Vietnam.
For the first scenario, ABC (SG) will be considered as providing warranty services in Vietnam and thus, subject to WHT on their total exporting value. For the latter, there should be no WHT incurred arguably.
On a separate note, the Agreement stated that the limit for removal/replacement of non-conforming goods is equal to EUR2,000 or above per each claim. As such, it can be understood that for any claim valued less than EUR2,000, ABC (VN) has to bear all the costs regarding to the recall of unqualified products. To ABC (VN)’s position, if the cause of the event is not the Company’s fault, all related expenses may not be deductible for CIT purpose.
On the repurchasing of products upon termination of the distribution agreement
As agreed, upon termination of the Agreement, ABC (SG) may, at its sole discretion upon notice to ABC (VN), repurchase all unsold inventory of ABC (VN) at a price equal to ABC (VN)’s distribution cost.
In connection with the potential challenges where the tax authorities deem ABC (SG) to still take ownership of the goods within Vietnam territories, this provision may increase the risk to a higher level. For avoidance of unnecessary challenges from the tax authorities, the repurchasing should be subject to mutual agreement between the two parties, instead of at sold discretion of ABC (SG). 
Furthermore, to ABC (VN), the resale to ABC (SG) at cost basis may trigger the transfer pricing risk on the ground that the prices are not in accordance with the arms’ length basis (i.e. lower than prices applied for third-party customers, which normally have mark-up on that) and thus, being subject to a deemed tax position.
On the use of trademarks
It is stated that ABC (SG) authorizes distributor to use the trademark, solely for the promotion, marketing, distribution, sale of the products in the Territory. 
In accordance with Circular 103/2014/TT-BTC, royalty income shall be subject to 10% CIT. The act where ABC (SG) allows ABC (VN) to use their trademark will trigger the WHT risk for this portion, and even the Agreement is silent about whether ABC (VN) has to pay any royalty fee to ABC (SG) or not, tax authority may still challenge that the fee is included into the contract lumpsum amount.
Circular 103 also regulates that in case there are multiple work items within a contract which are subject to different WHT rates but there is no value breakdown for each work item, then the highest WHT rate shall be imposed on total contract value. 
From our review and discussion with the Company, we understand that the trademark is for promotion and marketing purpose only, to ensure that ABC (VN) will not misuse the "ABC" Trademark for any other purposes as well as to prove the origin of the goods. 
To mitigate the risk, where applicable, the parties may consider emphasizing this sole purpose and that the trademark granted from ABC (SG) is royalties free. Notwithstanding that, subject to this sensitive arrangement of using trademark, the Company may still have to explain to authorities in the future.
On the MAAs 
We noted that the SA also scrutinized on the MAAs and interpreted that ABC (SG) sells goods to Vietnam while renting another party (i.e. ABC (VN)) to carry out the MAAs as the services. On the understanding that the MAA is, indeed, an application submitted by a drug manufacturer seeking marketing authorisation (i.e. asking for permission to bring a medicinal product to the market), the authorisation of ABC (SG) to ABC (VN) to obtain the MAAs should be considered as a typical licensing requirement for market entry of ABC (SG) as being the drug manufacturer, rather than a services associated with the goods distribution in Vietnam. 
Nevertheless, for avoidance of doubt, the arrangement of authorising ABC (VN) to obtain the MAAs and MAAs handling should be carved out to a separate agreement. 
On the prices and tax related terms
As per Clause 5.3, prices do not include sales, excise, use or other taxes, duties or fees now in effect or hereinafter levied that ABC (SG) may be required to pay or collect . For a clear allocation of tax cost between the parties, the tax, duties, or fees imposed / collected under which jurisdictions (i.e. under Singapore jurisdiction, or under Vietnam jurisdiction, or under both jurisdictions, etc.) should be specifically defined. 

Other terms that may trigger CIT risks to ABC (VN)
Clause 3.5 on monthly reporting of sales, Clause 5.1 on logistic procedures and clause 5.4 on payment method refer to “the ongoing group procedures” rather than specifying for ABC (VN)’s case. Given that ABC (VN) is considered as a separate entity for tax reporting, the tax authorities would normally not allow the cross reference for tax purposes. It is important for the payment method (e.g. by bank transfer, or by net off method, etc.) to be contractually agreed and concluded. If not, the tax authorities may challenge on the costs paid by ABC (VN) to ABC (SG) as not qualifying the “non-cash payment condition” for CIT deduction. 
If ABC (VN) wishes to adopt the group policies / procedures, such policies / procedures should be extracted and incorporated as a part of the agreement between ABC (SG) and ABC (VN).
