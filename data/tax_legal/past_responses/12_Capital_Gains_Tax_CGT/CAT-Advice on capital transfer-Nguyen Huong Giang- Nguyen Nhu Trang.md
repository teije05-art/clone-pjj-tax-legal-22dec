Vietnamese tax implications on the capital transfer

Capital Assignment Tax
Under the Vietnamese regulations, any enterprise that receives income from a capital transfer is required to declare and pay tax on the capital transfer transaction, herein known as CAT. Given this, the transferors will be subject to CAT at the rate of 20% on any gain derived from the contemplated capital transfer. 
Basis for CAT calculation
The CAT taxable income generated from the capital transfer is calculated as follows: 
		     
     =                            -    -                                               -      -

Under which:
(i) The transfer price:
The transfer price is determined as the price paid by foreign transferees to the transferors for the transferred capital, which should be indicated in the Capital Transfer Agreement to be signed by and between the transferors and the potential transferee.
Technically, the transfer price should be determined on an arm’s length principle. Where the Capital Transfer Agreement does not state the transfer price or the Vietnamese tax authority has grounds to determine that the capital transfer transaction is not carried out at arm’s length, the Vietnamese tax authority has the right to re-assess and deem a market value of the transfer on the basis of prices of other capital transfer at the same time, by the same economic organization or prices in similar capital transfer contracts. The transfer price assessed by a competent professional valuation organization will be used in case the transfer price imposed by the tax authority is not reasonable.
Based on the above, the transfer price should be set on an arm’s length basis to mitigate any risk of being challenged by the Vietnamese tax authority. The basis for the determination of transfer price and the related supporting documents should be properly maintained to avoid any challenge from the Vietnamese tax authority on the transfer price. 
 (ii) The original value of the transferred capital: 
In case of transfer of contributed capital for enterprise establishment, the original value shall be the accumulated value of contributed capital up to the date of capital transfer as stated on accounting books, invoices, and other documents and certified by investors or participants in the business cooperation contract or according to audit report provided by an independent audit company if the enterprise is a foreign-owned enterprise;
In case of capital redemption from another investor, the original value shall be the value of capital at the time of redemption (determined by capital transfer agreement).

(iii) Transactional expenses:
Transactional expenses are the actual expenses incurred in relation to the capital transfer which are supported by legitimate invoices/supporting documents. For those expenses incurred overseas, all original supporting documents/invoices must be notarized by an authorized body/an independent auditor of the foreign country and must be translated into Vietnamese. 
Transactional expenses, under the Vietnamese regulations, might include:
legal expenses necessarily incurred in connection with the transfer;
expenses and levies payable upon implementation of transfer procedures;
expenses relating to communications, negotiations and entering into capital transfer agreement; and
other expenses with appropriate evidential documentation.
For the contemplated capital transfer, it is recommended that legitimate invoices/supporting documents for all actual expenses incurred in relation to the capital transfer should be obtained and properly maintained for being deducted from the taxable income for CAT purpose.
Transactional currency
Pursuant to the applicable Vietnamese regulations:
If the Vietnamese Company has its functional accounting currency in foreign currencies (e.g. USD) in accordance with regulations of law on accounting, the transfer price and the original value of the transferred capital shall be expressed in a foreign currency (i.e. USD) and no conversion is required.
In case the Vietnamese Company has its functional accounting currency in VND, the transfer price must be converted into VND according to the buying rate announced by the commercial bank, where the direct investment capital bank account of the Vietnamese Company is opened, at the time of transfer. This requirement of currency translation may give rise to a material taxable gain due to foreign exchange difference.
As the Company uses VND as its functional accounting currency, the transfer price will be converted into VND by using exchange rate announced by the commercial bank where the Company's capital account is opened at the time of transfer (to determine the transfer price).
CAT filing and payment requirements
Responsibility to declare and pay CAT:
If the potential transferee is foreign organization not conducting business in Vietnam under the Law on Investment or Law on Enterprises, the Company whose capital is being transferred shall be responsible to declare and pay CAT to the local tax department on behalf of the transferors.
If the potential transferee is a Vietnamese organization, the transferee shall be responsible for CAT declaration and payment to the HTD on behalf of the transferors.
Deadline for CAT declaration and payment:
Pursuant to the current Vietnamese regulations on tax administration, the CAT declaration are to be submitted within ten (10) days after the capital transfer is approved by competent licensing authority or the commencement date of the agreement (in case the transfer is not required to obtain the approval from the competent authorities)· The deadline for CAT payment is the same time with the CAT declaration deadline.
For the contemplated capital transfer, apparently the competent authority (i.e. the Ministry of Finance (“MOF”)) usually issue an in-principle approval but the final approval is when the new shareholder is registered by the MOF, i.e. on completion of the capital transfer transaction. The current Vietnamese tax regulations are less than clear on the deadline for CAT declaration and payment in this case. However, it might be arguable that the 10-day period runs from the date when the final approval is made (i.e. when the new shareholder is registered by the MOF), on the basis the transaction may not complete even after the MOF issues the in-principal approval), which is conditional upon other conditions precedent being completed. Note that this might be subject to explanation with the tax authority if being challenged.
Dossier for CAT declaration:
A CAT declaration return (Form 05/TNDN issued with Circular 156/2013/TT-BTC);
A copy of the capital transfer agreement. In case the agreement is made in a foreign language, the following main contents must be translated into Vietnamese: the transferor; the transferee; the point of transfer; transfer contents; rights and obligations of each party; contractual value; time, mode and currency used for payment;
A copy of the decision approving the capital transfer issued by the MOF;
A copy of the capital contribution certificate. In practice, in order to prove for the contributed charter capital before transfer, the latest audited financial statement or the latest Business License might be used; 
Original supporting documents for transactional expenses (i.e. contracts, original invoices, etc.) (if any); and
A copy of the updated Business License after the capital transfer is completed (required per our observation in practice.
Where additional documents are required, the tax authority will inform within the day of receiving the dossier in case of direct submission; or within three (03) days in case of submission via post or e-filing. 
Note, CAT declaration is required even in case DTA exemption is notified to the local tax authority. 
Other taxes
Under the current Vietnamese regulations, no Value Added Tax ("VAT”) and other taxes will be imposed on the contemplated transfer of capital.
