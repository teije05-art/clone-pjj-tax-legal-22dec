Vietnamese Foreign Contractor Tax and Value Added Tax implications
Background
ABC Company  (“the Company” or “ABC”) is a company incorporated in Singapore. The Company wholesales and distributes electrical industrial machinery and equipment for measurement and chemical analysis.

XYZ Company (“the distributor” or “XYZ”) is a Vietnamese company, having its registered office at Hoang Mai District, Hanoi, Vietnam. The main business activity of XYZ is to wholesales machinery, equipment, and spare parts.

ABC does not have a legal presence in Vietnam and sells its equipment through the distributor to customers in Vietnam. In order for Vietnamese customers (or prospective customers) to better understand ABC’s equipment and their capabilities, the Company has an arrangement whereby certain equipment is loaned to XYZ as for demonstration purposes.

The equipment loan agreement (“the Agreement”) was signed in 2019, in which:

The loaned equipment only consists of the hardware as stated in the Exhibit A of the Agreement.
XYZ only can use the loaned equipment for purposes stated in the Article 3 of the Agreement, specifically solely for the purposes of application and solutions development, performing demonstrations to ABC’s customers and potential customers. In addition, the loaned equipment will be used for ABC seminars, symposium, masterclasses, workshops or such other events as are mutually agreed between and by two parties.

ABC retains all right, title and ownership to the loaned equipment, unless it is purchased by the distributor after the loan period (i.e. 18 months).

Only ABC or its authorized service providers may provide installation, maintenance or support services on the loaned equipment.

The purchase price, in the purchase option stated in Article 15 of the Agreement, will be at a 65% discount from the list price as determined by ABC. No software and/or intellectual property will be transferred by ABC to the distributor upon the disposal of the loaned equipment.

ABC assumed all related costs of bringing the loaned equipment physically into Vietnam, including shipping costs, Valued added Tax (“VAT”) and import duties at the import stage, etc. The loaned equipment was delivered by ABC to the distributor in May 2019 with the customs declaration under A11 code for importation procedures (i.e. Import for consumption and for trading). The import VAT was declared and paid to the State Budget based on the list price of the loaned equipment at import stage.

As stated in the Agreement, the distributor has a right to purchase the loaned equipment from ABC after the loan period. Now, the distributor is intending to buy this loaned equipment. ABC is currently concerned on the following matters:

Vietnamese Foreign Contractor Tax (“FCT”) and VAT implications on the distributor’s purchase of the loaned equipment; and

The possibility to apply the relevant tax treaty for tax exemption, where applicable
Please advise if any of the above understanding is not correct as it may materially impact our comments hereunder.

FCT and VAT implications
Overview of Vietnamese taxation
Foreign Contractor Tax (“FCT”) is a comprehensive tax collection regime that applies to, amongst others, foreign business organizations, with or without permanent establishment (“PE”) in Vietnam, doing business in Vietnam or having Vietnam-sourced income on the basis of a contract, agreement or undertaking with Vietnamese organizations. Broadly, FCT is a collection mechanism for Corporate Income Tax (“CIT”) and Value Add Tax (“VAT”).
Conceptually, FCT will not be applied if the goods are supplied with the place of delivery at the border gates, and without accompanied services provided in Vietnam.
For goods delivered within the territories of Vietnam, the applicable tax rates for trading activities will be applied at 1% deemed CIT and 1% deemed VAT on the value of goods. Technically, for imported goods, which has been subject to VAT at import stage, VAT portion of FCT would be exempt.
Obligations for FCT declaration and payment: Except where the foreign entity is qualified to register and directly file taxes to the Vietnamese tax authority, the responsibility to withhold, declare and pay FCT is rest with the Vietnamese contracting party.
FCT implications in relation to the distributor’s contemplated purchase of the loaned equipment
With the equipment loan arrangement whereby ABC still retains the ownership of the loaned equipment in Vietnam until it is sold to the distributor, ABC is considered as carrying out trading activities within Vietnam territory when selling such equipment to the distributor and thus, subject to FCT in Vietnam under the domestic regulations.
In principle, the income earned by the foreign entity from selling goods in Vietnam will be used as the income base for FCT determination. For ABC’s case, the income generated from the sales of loaned equipment is the price at a 65% discount from the list price as determined by the Company. Hence, technically, the payment from XYZ to the Company will be subjected to FCT at 1% CIT and VAT exempt as ABC already paid VAT at the import stage.
However, in consideration of the following facts as shown in the documents provided by the Company:
the loaned equipment was imported to Vietnam under A11 code, i.e. for consumption and trading purposes (rather than for lending purpose, which should be imported under temporary import for re-export procedure. Note that there are several custom procedure codes for temporary import and re-export of goods regulated in the applicable regulation. As we are not customs expert, it is recommended that the Company should request the distributor seeking the proper consultation from local customs authority in this regard, and
the value of equipment as purchased by the distributor would be much lower than its value declared for customs declaration purposes, 
there is a high risk that the FCT implications for the contemplated transaction would be much different from the principle above.
Per our verbal discussion with the Hanoi Tax Department (“HTD”) and General Department of Taxation (“GDT”) on a no-name basis regarding the Company’s case, the tax officers hold the view that the contemplated transaction could not be treated as a normal trading of imported goods for FCT determination. Rather, the tax authority needs to carefully look into the transaction, from both form and substance perspectives, to determine the FCT obligations. Particularly:
If the distributor maintains sufficient documents and has proper explanation proving that the equipment was actually imported to Vietnam for demonstration purposes and the importation under A11 code was by mistake only, then:
The tax authority may accept that the equipment is actually disposed of by ABC to the distributor after a long period of display, hence the value of the equipment at the distributor’s purchase would be the FCT taxable value. Notwithstanding this, it is required under the Vietnamese tax administration regulation that the selling price for asset disposal must be on arm’s length basis. Therefore, if the selling price of the loaned equipment is not at the arm’s length, the tax authority would have the right to deem a market price of the equipment for FCT purpose. Of note, the current regulations do not have any specific guidance on how to determine an arm’s length price in such cases. Per our observation of several private rulings issued by local tax authorities, the net book value or the market price would likely be referred to by the tax authorities.
With regard to the FCT rate, the fact that:
(i) the original purpose of importation of the equipment to Vietnam was for demonstration purpose, rather than for trading; and
(ii) the sales price is not matched with the list price stated in the customs declaration. 
would trigger the risk that the tax authority might not accept that the equipment has been subject to import VAT at import stage for ABC’s claiming exemption of VAT portion of FCT. In such case, the tax authority would require the distributor to withhold and declare 1% VAT portion of FCT applicable to foreign entity’s trading of non-imported goods in Vietnam.
Alternatively, there may be the case the tax authority does not accept the agreed price of the loaned equipment based on the fact that the equipment was imported to Vietnam under A11 code, i.e. for consumption and trading purposes. In such case, there is a risk that the income base for determination of FCT is likely deemed by the tax authority as the list price stated in the customs declaration. But, in this case, no VAT liability will be additionally imposed due to it has already been paid at import stage as the sales price is matched with the list price in the customs declaration.
Pertaining to the above, to demonstrate that the FCT taxable value of the transaction should be the actual payment made by the distributor to ABC upon purchase of the loaned equipment, ABC should work with the distributor to prepare the proper explanation to the tax authority in order to prove that (i) the equipment was actually imported to Vietnam for demonstration purposes and the importation under A11 code was by mistake only; and (ii) the disposal value of the loaned equipment at a 65% discount from the list price is the market price. 
With regard to the FCT rates, while the CIT rate will be 1% on the selling price, VAT implication would be dependent on the interpretation of the local tax authority. As it is not clear under the current regulations that the selling price of the equipment must be matched with the value of the equipment denominated in the customs declaration such that ABC can claim exemption of VAT portion of FCT, it is suggested that ABC and the distribution seek an official confirmation from the competent tax authority in this regard.  Or alternatively, the Company may take a prudent option by applying the VAT rate of 1% as for trading of non-imported goods in Vietnam. Of note, this VAT portion would be treated as creditable VAT for the distributor, hence becomes cost neutral.
Under the current regulations, the distributor, as the Vietnamese contracting party, will be required to withhold, declare and pay tax to the local tax authority on behalf of ABC.
Other notes
In addition to the above, we would like to note that the equipment loan agreement does not have any term and condition relating to the tax obligation of each party. Therefore, it is recommended that ABC should supplement the appendix of the Agreement to regulate that all tax liabilities to be incurred in Vietnam shall be born by which party. This is to determine the sales price to be quoted on a Net or Gross basis. If not, the FCT liability shall be calculated based on Net basis. 
Possibility of tax relief under Double Tax Agreement between Vietnam and Singapore (“Vietnam - Singapore DTA”)
DTA provision

Where Vietnam enters into a Double Taxation Agreement with a country or territory for the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income (“DTA”), provisions agreed under the DTA will prevail in cases where differences exist between the domestic laws and the DTA. 

Broadly, the income that ABC earns from the Agreement should be considered as the “business profit”, which subsequently falls under the provision of Article 7 of Vietnam – Singapore DTA.  Accordingly, where ABC does not carry out its business in Vietnam through a permanent establishment (“PE”), there may be a chance for ABC to enjoy tax exemption for the CIT portion of the FCT. 

Paragraph 1, Article 7 of the DTA between Vietnam and Singapore on taxing of business profit, states that:

“The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as foresaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to the permanent establishment.”

PE provision 

A PE is broadly defined under Article 5 of the Vietnam - Singapore DTA as “a fixed place of business through which the business of the enterprise is wholly of partly carried on”.

Please refer to Appendix 2 for more details of PE under Vietnam – Singapore DTA.

Notwithstanding the above provision, following Clause 4, Article 5 of Vietnam – Singapore DTA, the term "permanent establishment" shall be deemed not to include:

a. the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise;

e. the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character;

Hence, with the underlying equipment loan arrangement, it is highly likely that ABC will be considered not to constitute a PE in Vietnam by virtue of the disposal of the loaned equipment if both of the following conditions are satisfied:

The loaned equipment given to the distributor is only for ABC’s display purpose;

The display activities have the preparatory or auxiliary character in the whole of ABC’s business activities. For example, if ABC is the manufacturer of the loaned equipment, then the display of such equipment at the distributor can be arguable as having the auxiliary character.

From the information and documents currently provided by the Company, with the purpose of the equipment displayed in Vietnam as in order for Vietnamese customers (or prospective customers) to better understand ABC’s instruments and their capabilities, and the equipment is maintained at the distributor as demonstration purpose, we assess the PE risk in relation to the loaned equipment and ABC’s disposal of the loaned equipment to the distributor would be low as long as ABC and the distributor maintain proper documents and explanation proving that the equipment was actually imported to Vietnam for demonstration purposes and the sale of the equipment is purely a one-off disposal of the equipment.

Notwithstanding the above, we note that the term “loan” used in the Agreement might trigger the interpretation that the equipment is delivered to the distributor for borrowing purpose, which may distort the “demonstration” purpose of the equipment and might lead to an adverse impact from taxation purpose and PE assessment. Pertaining the above, ABC should work with the distributor to consider and assess whether the underlying equipment loan transaction satisfies the above two conditions and prepare the proper explanation to the tax authority accordingly.

Of a side note, our consideration of the PE risk above is purely based on the information and documents provided by the Company in relation to the loaned equipment only. We understand that there may be other agreement(s) between ABC and the distributor in relation to the distributor’s distribution of ABC’s products in Vietnam. In addition, per our review of the Agreement, we note that ABC might perform the installation, maintenance or support services on the loaned equipment when it is placed in Vietnam. Whether these activities might trigger the PE constitution for ABC or not would require further analysis and assessment, which we are happy to assist the Company under a separate engagement, if requested.

Procedures for DTA exemption

In case ABC assess that the underlying equipment loan transaction satisfies the above two conditions and no PE is constituted in Vietnam in relation to ABC’s distribution/sale of equipment in Vietnam, ABC would be qualified to enjoy tax exemption (i.e. CIT portion) under the Vietnam – Singapore DTA. However, the tax exemption under the DTA is not automatically applied, but subject to a notification procedure to the tax authority within 15 days before the deadline of the first FCT declaration. The statutory bar for lodging the notification is three (03) years retrospectively back to the date of first income generation.  If requested, we are happy to assist the Company to perform the notification procedure under a separate engagement. 

Conclusion and recommendations 
As analysed above, it is important that ABC should ensure the sales price of such equipment to XYZ after the loan period compliant with market price principle. Otherwise, there is a risk that the FCT (1% CIT, VAT exempt) would be deemed at the list price stated in the customs declaration which is referred as the market price by the tax authority.

Even in the case whereby ABC can prove the sales price of such equipment at 65% discount from the list price is the market price, there remains the risk that the Company would be imposed the additional VAT portion at 1% applicable to foreign entity’s trading of non-imported goods in Vietnam.

ABC has a chance to enjoy the tax exemption (CIT portion) under Vietnam – Singapore DTA subject to ABC’s maintaining proper explanation and DTA notification dossiers.
