Memo on Vietnam tax and customs implications related to ABC Company’s contemplated business
Following the Multi-Firm Agreement between KPMG Taiwan and KPMG Vietnam regarding a contemplated transaction of ABC Company, we have set out below our comments on the Vietnam tax and customs implications related to the transaction for your reference and consideration.


Background information
ABC Co., Ltd. (“ABC” or “the Company”), a company incorporated in Taiwan is contemplating the following proposed business model related to Vietnam:

Goods supply
ABC Company would provide cross-bordered goods to Vietnam customers with the goods and invoicing arrangement illustrated as below:





Vietnam customers places orders through ABC Company
ABC Company to purchase products from affiliated companies in Taiwan, Japan or other countries and sell them directly to Vietnam customers (non-ABC affiliated companies).
ABC Company will rent a bonded warehouse (“BWH”) from a local logistic company (i.e. VMI), subsequently VMI will import products under the authorization of ABC Company.
Ownership is transferred when the goods are called-off in the bonded area to ABC Company’s customers. Subsequently, VMI will ship goods to ABC Company’s customers.

Warranty / Maintenance Work in Vietnam related to the above goods supply
For the warranty which is conducted within effective period of the warranty term for free of charge and maintenance services for which ABC Company would charge their customers, ABC Company is considering either of the following options:
Option 1: ABC Company engages a local ABC company to carry out the warranty / maintenance work and would pay the local ABC company all related expenses, including visa application and salary payments, labor and health insurance expenses for the involved personnel.
Option 2: ABC Company engages a local agency to carry out the warranty / maintenance work, and would pay the local agency all related expenses, including visa application and salary payments, labor and health insurance expenses for the involved personnel.
The involved personnel are directly engaged into the employment relationship with local ABC company / local agency, but not ABC Company.
Local ABC company / local agency would issue invoices to charge fees to ABC Company, meanwhile ABC Company would directly issue the invoices to charge maintenance fee to the Vietnam customers.
KPMG’s comments
Vietnam Tax Perspective
Vietnam tax implications to ABC Company, including but not limited to Vietnam withholding tax (“WHT”), value added tax (“VAT”), personal income tax (“PIT”) obligations
WHT implications to ABC Company for M&E sales through Vietnam BWH
Vietnam tax system imposes WHT on foreign contractors who do not have a tax presence in Vietnam but earn income from Vietnam. WHT comprise of Corporate Income Tax (“CIT”) and Value Added Tax (“VAT”).
Under the current regulations, a foreign contractor shall be subject to Vietnam WHT in certain cases, including but not limited to:
Foreign contractor supplying goods in Vietnam in the form of on-the-spot import and export and having income arising in Vietnam on the basis of a contract signed by such




foreign contractor with a Vietnam party or carrying out distribution of goods in Vietnam or supply of goods on international commercial terms – Incoterms whereby the seller shall bear risks relating to goods entering into the territory of Vietnam.
Foreign contractor conducting all or part of business or distribution activities for goods or provision of services in Vietnam when the foreign contractor remains the owner of the goods delivered to Vietnam party and is responsible for costs of distribution, advertising, marketing, quality of services or quality of goods delivered to Vietnam party; including the case in which a number of Vietnam parties are authorized or hired to carry out part of distribution services or other services relating to the sale of goods in Vietnam.
Pertaining to the contemplated model, we noted that ABC Company would store its goods in a BWH located in Vietnam. Upon demand request from the Vietnam customers, ABC Company would deliver the goods thereafter and the goods ownership would be transferred within the BWH.
As BWH is physically located in Vietnam, the sales transactions between ABC Company and its Vietnam customers should be subject to WHT. The applicable tax rate would be 1% for the CIT element, and VAT exempted on the assumption that the VAT has been paid by their Vietnam customers upon their importation procedures.
Vietnam customers would be responsible for the tax withholding, declaration and payment on behalf of ABC Company, which shall trigger upon the actual payment settlement.
Nevertheless, the provision of which party to bear the WHT triggered from the contract should be the commercial negotiation between ABC Company and their Vietnam customers, which subsequently must be clearly stipulated under the tax term of the contract.

WHT implications to ABC Company for Warranty/Maintenance work in Vietnam related to the above goods supply

Following the legal basis noted at Point 7 as aforementioned, in case ABC Company sells goods in Vietnam (i.e. either under the BWH scheme with ownership transferred in Vietnam, or under the scheme where the goods ownership is transferred outside Vietnam) while ABC Company would be responsible for warranty and/or maintenance services provided in Vietnam, such sales transactions of ABC Company would be subject to Vietnam WHT.
WHT would still trigger in case the warranty is provided for free-of-charge. However, if the warranty is conducted in overseas (i.e. Vietnam customers to send the goods to ABC Company), there should be no WHT in Vietnam.
Where the value of goods and services could be contractually separated with corresponding billing separation, the tax rate should be:
For the value of goods: 1% CIT and VAT exempted;
For the value of services: 5% CIT and 5% VAT.
In case the value of goods and services could not be separated, the highest WHT rates (i.e. 5% CIT and 5% VAT) would be applied on total contract value.
In case ABC only supplies goods without any associated service provision, except for the warranty provided within the warranty period, practically, the risk for the contract to be imposed at 5% CIT – 5% VAT on total contract value is not high. Arguably, the contract




should only be subject to 1% CIT on total contract value. This however should be heavily subject to the viewpoint and assessment of local tax authorities.
The current regulations also allow the deduction of taxable income for WHT if the foreign contractors sub-contract a part of the work to a registered taxpayers in Vietnam (i.e. local ABC entities or local agencies), the subcontracted value would be deducted for WHT calculation, provided that:
Local ABC entities and/or local agencies should be included into the list of subcontractor regulated under the main contract between ABC Company and the Vietnam customers;
ABC Company must provide the Vietnam customers with the invoices that local ABC entities / local agencies billed to ABC Company so that Vietnam customers could maintain the evidence of the deducted amount before they withhold and declare WHT. From commercial perspectives, Vietnam customers may get to know the margin that ABC Company earns from the services provided to them.

VAT implications to ABC Company

When ABC Company engages local subcontractors to carry out the warranty / maintenance services in Vietnam, those local subcontractors would issue a VAT invoice to ABC Company to collect the fee, and 10% VAT rate (i.e. the standard VAT rate currently) would be applied on the ground that the service is consumed within Vietnam territory.
Regarding the leasing fee of BWH, Vietnam tax authorities also concluded that BWH owners need to charge 10% VAT to the foreign organisation who rents the BWH for goods sales in Vietnam. In case BWH is rent for storage of goods before exportation, or storage for processing and re-export, etc., 0% VAT rate may be applied.


PIT implications to ABC Company

Under the current regulations, in case an individual gets paid by an income payer incorporated / registered tax in Vietnam, the income payer should be responsible for PIT withholding, declaration and payment on behalf of the employees. In case an individual gets paid by an overseas organisation, such individual must directly report his/her PIT to the tax authorities.
In ABC Company’s case, we understand that ABC Company fully subcontracts the work in Vietnam to either local ABC entities or local agencies without assigning any of its personnel to Vietnam. Thus, the PIT reporting obligations to the involved personnel of local ABC entities / local agencies should rest with those local subcontractors, but not ABC Company.
Risk whereby ABC Company may constitute a permanent establishment (“PE”) in Vietnam
Under Vietnam regulations, foreign contractors deriving income in Vietnam shall be subject to WHT regime. There is also regime to declare and pay tax on PE basis but is not very common because the determination of taxable income attributable to the PE is too complicated.




The assessment of whether a foreign contract would have a PE in Vietnam, normally is for the purpose of a Double Tax Treaty (“DTT”) relief.
As per Article 5, Vietnam – Taiwan DTT:
Article 5 Permanent Establishment
l. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "permanent establishment" means a fixed place of business through which the business of the enterprise is wholly or partly carried on.
….
3. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term "permanent establishment" shall be deemed not to include:
the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display of transport of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise;
the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or transport;
the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise;
the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise or of collecting information, for the enterprise;
the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character;
the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities mentioned in sub-paragraphs (a) to (e), provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character.
Pertaining to the above, the fact that ABC Company would rent a BWH (i.e. a fixed place) to conduct its sales activities rather than for storage or other auxiliary activities, it is likely that ABC Company would constitute a PE status in Vietnam.
Possibility of applying tax exemption / tax relief under the relevant double tax treaty

According to Clause 1, Article 7 of Vietnam – Taiwan DTT, the profits of an enterprise of a Contracting Party shall be taxable only in that Party unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting Party through a PE situated therein.
In conjunction with our assessment at Point 25 that ABC Company may be exposed to a PE risk in Vietnam, it is not likely that ABC Company could claim for a DTT relief under the relevant DTT.
Please also be noted that if ABC Company claims for a DTT relief, the DTT dossier must be submitted to the tax authorities for pre-approval. Within 30 to 45 working days from the submission date, the tax authorities would issue a decision confirming if the taxpayer is qualified for DTT relief or not.




Vietnam customs perspectives
Research and analysis of the feasibility of the business models from customs perspective
KPMG understands that the transaction includes the following parties:
ABC Company as the Seller;
ABC Company’s related parties as the Suppliers of the physical goods;
A logistics Company (i.e. VMI) that owns BWH in Vietnam; and
Third-party customers located in Vietnam as the Buyers.
Between ABC Company and the Buyers in Vietnam, there are already framework agreements for providing goods. When having demands for goods, the Buyers in Vietnam will raise the Purchase Orders (“POs”) and send them to ABC Company.
Based on the POs from Customers, ABC Company will then ask its related parties from Taiwan, Japan, or other countries as the ABC Company’s suppliers to prepare the goods and send them directly to VMI under ABC Company’s assignment for delivery to the Buyers in Vietnam.
In the BWH, goods from different shipments might need to be split and arranged based on the POs from the Buyers in Vietnam and subsequently, will be scheduled to deliver to them by the logistics company, under the assignment of the Seller – ABC Company.

The ownership of the goods will be transferred from ABC Company to the Buyers in Vietnam in the BWH only when the goods are under the customs procedure for importation by the Customers.

Under Vietnamese prevalent regulations, goods imported from overseas can be stored in BWH if it falls within one of the following categories1:
Goods of foreign owners who have yet signed sales contract with enterprises in Vietnam; or
Goods of Vietnamese enterprises imported from overseas pending for domestic consumption or exporting to a third country; or
Goods from overseas countries waiting for export to a third country.

Among the above mentioned three (03) cases, case (i) might be applicable for the current model. In particular, it could be understood that if ABC has yet signed any sale contract with Vietnamese Buyers, the goods will be able to be stored in the BWH.

However, as our understanding, Vietnamese Buyers will base on the framework agreements that already signed with ABC to directly order goods under the POs with specific information of goods such as quantities, specifications, amount, etc. As such, it might not satisfy the conditions stated in case (i) above as it could be deemed as the sales contracts (i.e., POs) between parties are signed before the time of the goods being

1 Clause 2, Article 85, Decree No.08/2015/ND-CP dated 21 January 2015




delivered into the BWH. Consequently, there remains a chance that the local customs authority might challenge about the storage of goods in the BWH in this case.

In Vietnam, from KPMG’s practical observations, there is highly likely that Vietnamese customs authorities might accept for the goods to be stored in the BWH before being imported into the Vietnamese market if the following are satisfied:
The framework agreements between overseas sellers (i.e., ABC Company) and Vietnamese Buyers only state the general terms without any specific information of goods such as quantities and amount; and
The date of POs is later than the date of goods entry into BWH.

Accordingly, ABC Company might consider applying this practice for its case to avoid any challenges from local customs authorities. For further prudence, ABC Company might seek guidance from the General Department of Customs (GDC) before any implementation. KPMG is willing to support ABC Company with such ruling under a separate engagement letter.
Comments addressing the followings on the business model under the current Vietnamese customs regulations:
Conditions of goods/ products stored in the BWH;

Goods imported from overseas companies can be stored in BWH if it satisfies the regulation according to Clause 2, Article 85, Decree 08/2015/ND-CP dated 21st January 20152 (please refer to Section 2.1.b for further details).

Please be noted that if the goods fall into the following cases, they will not be allowed to store in BWH3:
Goods that falsify trademark, name, or Vietnamese origin;
Goods that are dangerous to humans or pollute the environment; and
Goods which are banned from export, import, temporary suspension from export, import, except for having the permission of the Prime Minister.
It is highly recommended that ABC Company should review the list of goods before sending goods into the BWH in Vietnam.

3  Clause 4, Article 85, Decree No.08/2015/ND-CP dated 21 January 2015




Period of storing goods in BWH4

Goods will be stored in BWH for a period of twelve (12) months since the date that goods are placed into the BWH. In case of having reasonable grounds, the time limit might be extended once for not more than twelve (12) months.

Please note that, after the first twelve (12) months, if ABC Company wants to extend this time limit for no more than twelve (12) months, the ABC Company should authorize the logistics company to request in writing (i.e., an Official Letter) to the local customs authority in charge of managing the BWH. The local customs authority will then seek the approval of the Director of Customs Departments managing the BWH. After that, an approval in writing (i.e., an Official Letter) will be sent to the ABC Company and/or the logistic company and the local customs authority for execution.
Customs procedures for importing goods through BWH

A summary of the process of customs procedures is listed below, with details presented in the following sections:

Customs procedures for importing goods from ABC’s Suppliers into BWM5



4 Clause 1, Article 61, Law on Customs No.54/2014/QH13 dated 23 June 2014
5 Clause 1, Article 91, Circular No.38/2015/TT-BTC dated 25 March 2015, amended by Clause 59, Article 1, Circular No.39/2018/TT-
BTC dated 20 April 2018




The logistics company will act as an importer and carry out the customs procedures for importing goods into BWH. The logistics company needs to declare and submit all required documents together with the import CDs with instructions for declaration provided under Form No.01 of Appendix II of Circular 38/2015/TT-BTC (amended by Appendix I of Circular 39/2018/TT-BTC) via the e-customs declaration system6.

Please note that when importing goods into BWH, the logistics company should pay attention to the following contents of the CD forms:
Name of the exporter/ importer on the electronic import declaration7:
Importer’s name: the logistics company
Exporter’s name: ABC Company
In case the e-customs declaration system has not yet been supported, the logistics company can carry out customs procedure in the form of paper-based according to Clause 2, Article 25, Decree 08/2015/ND-CP amended and supplemented by Clause 12, Article 1, Decree 59/2018/ND-CP and submit two (02) original copies import customs declarations according to Form. HQ/2015/NK, Appendix IV, Circular 38/2015/TT-BTC amended and supplemented by Circular 39/2018/TT-BTC.

However, the logistics company still needs to notify in writing to the customs authority (where the customs procedure is expected to be carried out), which clearly states the name and cause of the problem, the expected time to fix the problem, and the method of carrying out customs declaration procedures during the time the e-customs declaration system has been trouble8.
Customs procedures for goods from BWH to customers in Vietnam9
The Buyers located in Vietnam, who might be local companies/ foreign direct investment companies in Vietnam or in free trade zones, should follow the below import customs procedure.

The Buyers have to declare and submit all required documents in a customs dossier for import via the e-customs system according to Form No.01, Appendix II, Circular No.38/2015/TT-BTC and Clause 2, Article 16, Circular No.38/2015/TT-BTC amended and supplemented by Clause 5, Article 1, Circular No.39/2018/TT-BTC or paper-based Form HQ/2015/NK, Appendix IV, Circular 39/2018/TT-BTC10

10 Clause 2, Article 16, Circular No. 38/2015/TT-BTC, amended and supplemented by Clause 5, Article 1, Circular No. 39/2018/TT- BTC




Importer’s name: the customer’s name
Exporter’s name: ABC Company
Transfer of ownership for goods in BWH
In this model, ABC Company will transfer the ownership of goods in BWH to the Buyers in Vietnam (i.e., sales of goods to the Buyers in Vietnam). This activity is considered commercial activity and regulated under Clause 8, Article 3, Commercial Law No 36/2005/QH11.11

The transfer of ownership of goods in BWH will be carried out by ABC Company upon the sale of goods and ABC Company needs to notify to the logistics company. The logistics company will send the Notification of the Transfer of Ownership of goods in BWH to the local customs authorities.

There are no customs procedures required at this stage because goods do not leave the BWH. The period of goods retention in the BWH begins from the day on which goods are delivered to the BWH according to the lease contract between the logistics company and ABC Company.12

Please note that the BWH owner is required to monitor and finalize the BWH lease contracts with goods owners and submit the Notification of goods condition and operation of the BWH to the local customs authority on every 15th day of the first month of each quarter.13
Customs duties relating to transactions through BWH

Goods imported from overseas into BWH are not subjected to customs duties because goods have not yet entered Vietnam territory14.

In case the goods are imported from BWH to Vietnamese Buyers/ non- Export processing enterprises (“non-EPE”), they will be subjected to customs duties according to Clause 2, Article 2, Decree No.134/2016/ND-CP15.

Otherwise, in case the goods are imported from BWH into EPEs, the EPEs will not be subjected to pay customs duties according to Clause 4, Article 2, Law on Export and Import No. 107/2016/QH1316.
Temporary importation of machinery and equipment (“M&E”) for warranty and maintenance services
Overview of temporary importation of M&E for warranty and maintenance services


11 Clause 8, Article 3, Commercial Law No 36/2005/QH11
12 Clause 8, Article 91, Circular No. 38/2018/TT-BTC, amended by Clause 59, Article 1, Circular No.39/2018/TT-BTC
13 Clause 9, Article 91, Circular No. 38/2015/TT-BTC, amended by Clause 59, Article 1, Circular No. 39/2018/TT-BTC
14 Clause 4, Article 2, Law on Export and Import No. 107/2016/QH13
15 Clause 2, Article 2, Decree No.134/2016/ND-CP
16 Clause 4, Article 2, Law on Export and Import No. 107/2016/QH13




Referring to the given model and the background information, KPMG understands that the M&E would be temporary import and re-export goods since these goods are planned to be used for a certain period and would be returned to the owner once the maintenance period is finished.

The local ABC company or a local agency will be in charge of the warranty and maintenance process. As such, these companies might carry out the related customs procedures for the importation of M&E with the purpose of maintenance and repair.

Please be noted that the importation of used M&E might be controlled under the relevant regulations of Vietnam. As the information of such M&E and the type of contract (e.g., separated services provision contract, maintenance services included in the sale contract, etc.) are not available at the time of this memo, the Company is highly recommended to review the M&E information (specifications, HS codes, ages, etc.,) before carrying out any customs procedures.
