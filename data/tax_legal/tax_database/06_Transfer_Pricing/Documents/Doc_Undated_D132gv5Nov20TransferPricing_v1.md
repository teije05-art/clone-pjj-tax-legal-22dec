CHAPTER 2

Analysis, Comparison and Selection of Independent Comparables and Methods for Fixing the
Price of a Related Transaction
Article 6	Principles for analysis and comparison
An analysis and comparison of a related transaction is undertaken on the principle of the real nature of the operation or transaction [substance over form] in order to decide the tax obligation and to identify the substance of the related transaction:
A comparison is made between the legal contract or transaction ag reement or document of the related parties with the actual conduct by the parties. If a taxpayer has a related transaction but there are no written agreements or if any existing written agreement is inconsistent with the independe nt transaction principle [arms' length principle] or if the actual conduct of the transaction is inconsistent with the arms' length principle between unrelated parties, then the related party transaction must be determined in accordance with its true business nature as if between independent [non-related] parties as follows: a related party receiving income or profit from a related transaction with a taxpayer must have the ownership and business risk controlling right with respect to the assets, goods, services, resources or rights with economic interests attached and must have the rig ht to create income f rom shareholding, share certificates and other f inancial instruments and the taxpayer incurring expenses as a result of the transaction with the related party must receive actual b enefits and economic value or a contribution to the creation of turnover or added value to the production and business activities of such taxpayer in compliance with the arms' length principle;

The nature of the transaction is determined by the method of collating information, source vouchers and data about the transaction and the risks of the related parties during the actual conduct of production and business.
An analysis and comparison of the related transaction with independent transactions:
The bases for comparing contracts, documents and agreements, and the economic, commercial and f inancial relationship in a related transaction of the taxpayer are data and the actual conduct of the transaction between the related parties in order to make a comparison of same with business decisions which might be approved by independent parties in similar conditions. The p rinciple on comparison which is applied during analysis and comparison attaches more importance to the actual substance and business practice and to the risks incurred by the related parties rather than to their written agreements;
A comparability analysis must ensure that there is a similarity between the independent comparables and the related transaction, without material differences affecting the price level, profit ratio or p rofit split ratio between the parties. If there are such material differences affecting such items, then there must be a further analysis, determination and adjustment by eliminating the material differences from the comparables via a comparison of the factors prescribed in articles 7 and 10 of this Decree and in compliance with each method for fixing the price of a related transaction [transfer pricing method] stipulated in articles 13, 14 and 15 of this Decree.
Article 7	Selection of independent comparables

Selection of internal independent comparables means selection of transactions between the taxpayer and unrelated parties ensuring similarity and no material differences regarding price level, profit rat io or profit split ratio between the parties. If there are no such similar internal independent comparables, then comparables shall be chosen in accordance with sub-clauses (b) and (c) of article 17. 3 of this Decree. A comparison between a related transaction [the controlled transaction] and an independent transaction [uncontrolled transaction] is conducted on the basis of comparing each transaction with each similar product. If transactions are not able to be compared based on products, then the agglomeration of transactions must ensure consistency regarding their nature/substance and actual business practice, and a transfer pricing method prescribed in articles 12, 13, 14 and 15 of this Decree must be applied.
Financial data of comparables must be reliable for use in declaring and assessing tax and must comply with the regulations on accounting, statistics and taxation. The time [period] when the comparable transactions were conducted must be the same as the time of the related transaction o r their f iscal year must the same as the fiscal year of the taxpayer, except in a special case when it is necessary to extend the comparison period as prescribed in article 9 of this Decree. D ata formats must ensure that price levels are comparable and assessable as at the time of the t ransactions or within the same tax assessment period; and data comparing profit ratios or profit split ratios must b e taken within at least three consecutive tax assessment periods. The taxpayer should round up value ratios and corresponding ratios to the second digit after the decimal point. If relative figures are taken f rom announced data which does not have absolute numbers attached and the relative figures have not been rounded up, then these figures should be taken from data which has been announced and which also cites its sources.
The minimum number of independent comparables to be selected after comparability analysis and adjustment of material differences is as follows: one comparable if there is no difference between the related transaction of the taxpayer conducting the related transaction and the independent comparable; three comparables if there are differences between the comparables but there is sufficient information and data for eliminating the material differences; and five comparables if there

is only information and data for eliminating most of the material differences between the independent comparables.
Article 8	Adjusting price levels, profit ratios and profit split ratios of the taxpayer

In a case of looking at independent comparables with equal reliability and with no differences, or with differences but with enough information and data to provide the basis for excluding important differences:
If the price level, profit ratio or profit split ratio of the taxpayer is within the rang e of independent transactions' value (arms' length range) of the comparables, then the taxpayer is not required to adjust the price level, profit ratio or profit split ratio in order to fix the price of the related transaction;
If the price level, profit ratio or profit split ratio of the taxpayer is not within the arms' length rang e of the comparables, then the taxpayer must determine a value/price within the arms' length range which ref lects the highest degree of similarity to the related transaction in order to adjust the price level, profit ratio or profit split ratio of the related transaction but without reducing taxable income or the tax obligation owed by the taxpayer to the State budget.
If there is only data information providing the basis to eliminate most of the material differences of the independent comparables, then at least five independent comparables must be selected and the standard arm's length range shall be applied in accordance with the guidelines in Appendix 54 issued with this Decree. The selection of a value/price within the standard arm's leng th rang e in o rder to adjust and re-determine the price level, profit ratio or profit split ratio of the taxpayer is made as following:
If the price level, profit ratio or profit split ratio of the taxpayer is a value/price within the standard arm's length range of the similar independent comparables, then the taxpayer is not required to amend its price level, profit ratio or profit split ratio in order to fix the price of the related transaction;
If the price level, profit ratio or profit split ratio of the taxpayer is a value/price not within the standard arm's length range of the similar independent comparables, then the taxpayer must determine a value within the standard arm's length range which reflects the highest degree of similarity with the related transaction in order to amend the price level, profit ratio or profit split ratio of the related transaction and to fix taxable income and the amount of tax payable without reducing such taxable income or tax obligation payable to the State budget;
If the tax office amends or fixes the price level, profit ratio or profit split ratio of the taxpayer, then the adjusted or fixed price/value shall be the median value of the standard arm's length range.
Based on the transfer pricing method and the selected independent comparab les, an amendment shall be made to the price level, profit ratio or profit split ratio of the taxpayer in o rder to f ix the corporate income tax [CIT] obligation of the taxpayer without reducing the amount of the tax obligation owing to the State budget.
Article 9	Expanding the scope of analysis and comparison
If a related transaction is unique or has special characteristics so that independent comparables are unable to be found in order to conduct a comparison, then the scope of the comparative analysis shall be expanded in terms of the industry, geographical markets and period of comparison in o rder to f ind independent comparables. Such expansion of the scope of the comparative analysis shall be carried out as follows:
Selection of independent comparables in accordance with the statistical economic sub-sector with the highest similarity to the taxpayer's sub-sector of operation in the same local or domestic market;

4	Allens footnote: The Appendices have not been translated.

Expansion of the comparative geographical area to regional countries which have s imilar industry conditions and a similar level of economic development.
If there is an expansion of the scope of analysis and selection of independent comparables to the above-mentioned geographical areas, then there must be an analysis of the significant q ualitative and quantitative differences in accordance with articles 10.6 and 14 of this Decree or use must be made of f igures and data of the independent comparables in the previous year while making adjustments for the time factor difference (if any).
The extended time for selecting figures and data of independent comparables shall not exceed one f iscal year compared to the fiscal year of the taxpayer if using the transfer pricing method prescribed in article 14 of this Decree [transactional net margin method].
Article 10 Criteria for analysing, comparing and adjusting material differences.

An analysis and comparison applying the method of comparing, reviewing and ad justing material differences of the independent comparables comprises a consideration of the special characteristics of the goods, services or assets (hereinafter abbreviated as product characteristics); operational functions, assets, and production and business risks5; contractual conditions and the economic conditions in which the transaction took place.
Product characteristics means characteristics or properties which affect the price of a product comprising tangible characteristics such as physical properties, product quality, the brand o r t rade name of the product, its reliability, availability and volume/quantity offered; service character ist ics such as nature/substance, complexity, expertise and scope of the services; intangible asset characteristics such as the form of transfer, type of asset/ property, form of o wnership, term [ of ownership], degree of ownership protection, term of transfer, rights to be transferred and benefits obtained from using the intangible assets.
An analysis of intangible assets and distribution of profit to the related parties is based no t o nly on legal ownership also on all activities of risk management and the financial capacity to manage risks during the entire process of development, enhancement, maintenance, protection and exploitation [DEMPE] of the intangible assets as between the related parties. This analysis and comparison are based on a number of characteristics of intangible assets such as any monopoly, the scope and term of legal protection of the assets; rights established pursuant to a protection title, licence or written transfer of rights in the intangible assets; the geographical scope/extent of the rights to the intangible assets, their life cycle, developmental stage; the right to increase their value, change and up date such intangible assets; and the forecast profitability of the intangible assets;
An analysis of the special characteristics of intangible assets includes a d etermination of which assets are used or transferred during a transaction, and specific and material economic risks relevant to their DEMPE; an identification of agreements reached in contracts such as legal ownership of the intangible assets, the terms and conditions of such legal agreements; registration, agreements o n licensing and related contracts and on risks attached; an identification of the party performing the function of exploitation and use of the assets and risk management reg arding their D EMPE; an identification of contractual terms and conditions and the actual practice of the parties; an identification of the actual nature of the related transaction relevant to DEMPE of the intangible assets when considering their legal ownership and relationships, rights pursuant to relevant contracts, the actual conduct by the parties and a determination of the price/value of the transaction



5	Allens footnote: The OECD transfer pricing guidelines state that regard must be had to what the taxpayer obtained in re tu rn for the functions it performed, the assets it used, and the risks it assumed.

consistent with the parties' contribution, actual functions performed, assets used and ri sks actually assumed by the parties.
The following are analysed namely the operational function, assets, and production and business risks performed by each party and the assets, production and business risks in relation to opportunity costs, economic and industry conditions, operational sector and geographical location of the taxpayer, such items to be analysed in order to identify factors reflecting the taxpayer's ability to profit f rom the business operation and the actual business practice conducted by the taxpayer associated with functions and use of the relevant assets, capital and costs.
The results of an analysis reflect the main function in the relationship between the use of the various types of assets, capital and opportunity costs such as the risks associated with investment in such assets, capital and costs with the ability to take profit as performed by the taxpayer regarding the business transaction and in particular:
Some of the main functions of the enterprise are analysed throughout the entire value chain of the Group including research and development [R&D] such as providing R&D services pursuant to a contract or autonomous R&D; technical development and product design; production or manufacture including autonomous production, licensed production, processing pursuant to a contract or outsourcing, and installation of equipment; trading and managing raw materials and other t rading activities; distribution including autonomous distribution, limited risk distribution, commission agency, wholesale or retail distribution; provision of support services such as legal, financial accounting, debt collection, personnel training, and maintenance; provision of transport or storage services; conducting brand development activities such as marketing, advertising, market research or exercising other functions throughout the industry value chain;
Some of the main assets of the enterprise comprise intangible assets such as technical know -how, copyright, business know-how, secret formulae, patents, and intangible assets relevant to commercial and marketing activities such as brand names, system building and b rand identity; customer lists, data and relationships; tangible assets such as factories, machinery and eq uipment; and f inancial assets and economic interests and benefits derived from such assets during the course of their exploitation, use and transfer;
Some of the main risks while conducting business include strategic or market risks resulting f rom implementing business strategies such as market entry, market maintenance or market expansion; infrastructure or inventory/storage risks; financial risks such as credit risks, bad debts and exchange rate risks; transaction risks such as price factors and terms and conditions on payment during commercial transactions; product risks arising from developmental design and production up until quality control and after-sales service; business risks f rom capital investment, the volume of customers, and risks of force majeure events.
An analysis of the business risks of the taxpayer throughout the entire value chain of the Group is aimed at identifying major risks to the entire industry value chain, and the ability to control risks such as making risk management decisions and dealing with the risks when they actually occur comprising identification of key economic risks; an assessment of the level of risk allocation and settlement in the legal contracts or agreements of the taxpayer; an analysis of the function of risk control and risk mitigation stipulated in legal contracts or written agreements; and a check and review of the actual status of implementation and ho w the taxpayer's risks were actually allocated and borne. If there are differences between the risk allocation stipulated in legal contracts or written agreements as compared to the actual conduct of the p arties, then based on the results of this risk analysis the tax office shall reallocate risks and adjust the tax payer's price level, profit ratio and/or profit split ratio.
The contractual terms and conditions when conducting the transaction comprise terms and conditions on volume, trading conditions or product distribution; time, conditions and method of

payment; conditions on warranty, replacement, upgrade, amendment or modification to p roducts; conditions on exclusive rights to trade and distribute the products; and a number of other conditions which could have an economic affect such as support services, consultancy on quality control, use guidelines, and support for advertising and promotion.
If the terms and conditions of the legal contract or written agreement between the parties do not fully ref lect their actual practice, then there must be an analysis and comparison of such actual conduct or of the f inancial data in order to determine the characteristics, economic substance and actual business risks incurred by the parties;
If the related parties did not sign a legal contract or written agreement and do not recognize revenue and expenses such as technical assistance, assistance of the Group, sharing business know-how o r secondment/part-time use of personnel, then an analysis must be conducted in order to determine the substance of the transaction, its value, the income generated from it and the contribution made by each of the related parties. On such basis, a comparison may be made with business decisions which would be acceptable by independent parties in similar conditions in o rder to redefine the related transaction of the taxpayer.
Economic conditions of the transaction and market conditions as at the time the t ransaction arose which could impact the price, profit ratio or profit split ratio.
A number of economic conditions existing when the transaction took place such as the s ize and geographical position of the production and consumption markets, and the market level such as whether it was wholesale, normal retail or exclusive distribution; the product's competitiveness in the market and the relative competitive positions of the seller and buyer; the availability of substitute goods; the level of supply and demand in the market generally and in each specific area, and the purchasing power of consumers; economic factors affecting the costs of production and business existing in the location where the transaction took place such as policies on tax incentives, and the market regulation policies of the Government; production costs, land costs, labour and capital costs; the business cycle and factors with a positive effect on the taxpayer's price level, profit ratio or p rofit split ratio such as characteristics regarding the location, advantages and cost savings based o n geographical, market and local characteristics and also on the workforce, concentration of synergy functions and specialized or expert contribution made by the related parties in creating value;
If the taxpayer and the comparables do not reside in the same country or territory, or do not p rovide goods and services in the same geographical market, then an analysis of the economic conditions shall comprise an analysis of the degree of similarity between the markets where the taxpayer on the one hand resides and such comparables on the other hand reside with respect to comparative advantages, and location affecting comparative factors such as the cost of labour, cost of raw materials, transport, land  rent, expenses for training  and  assistance, any incentives regarding  f inance, tax and infrastructure costs, growth level of the markets and market advantages such as population numbers and numbers of customers with good spending power and any other comparable advantages.
A comparability analysis and elimination of material differences means an analysis and elimination of both qualitative and quantitative differences of information or financial figures which have a major impact on the factors used as the basis for determining the price of the related transaction in accordance with each of the pricing methods prescribed in articles 13, 14 and 15 of this D ecree. Quantitative differences mean differences determined by absolute numbers regarding the b usiness cycle, and the number of years for which the enterprise has been established and o perating, o r by relative numbers such as differences in financial indicators according to the characteristics of the investment industry or operational function, and differences regarding working capital; while qualitative differences mean information determined and based on each method for fixing the price of the related transaction as prescribed in articles 13, 14 and 15 of this Decree.

Information determined to be critical comprises differences regarding product characteristics, contractual conditions, functions, assets, risks, the business industry or trade, and economic conditions of the taxpayer and of the independent comparables; differences regarding p olicies and the investment environment, and the input costs of production and business in local, d omestic and overseas areas;
Quantitative and qualitative differences must be reviewed and ad justed as corresponding to the comparative factors with a critical impact on the transfer pricing methods stipulated in articles 13, 14 and 15 of this Decree.
The results of analysis provide the basis for selecting independent comparables appropriate for each transfer pricing method stipulated in articles 13, 14 and 15 of this Decree. If the taxpayer fails to adjust the price, profit rate or profit split ratio in accordance with the independent comparables for the reason that qualitative and quantitative differences cause a material impact, then the taxpayer must search and reselect independent comparables in order to determine a standard arms' leng th range ensuring reliability, uniformity and an adjustment of the price of the related transaction in accordance with the provisions of this Decree.
Article 11	Sequence for analysis and comparison
Identification of the substance/nature of the related transaction before conducting an analysis of its similarity with independent comparables.
Analysis, comparison, search and selection of similar independent comparab les on the basis of determining the comparison time, the product characteristics and the contractual conditions; an analysis of the industry, market and economic conditions where and when the transaction aro se; an analysis of the related transaction and of the taxpayer conducting it; an identification of the database source, of the transfer pricing method and adjustment of material differences, and in particular:
A determination of the scope, contents and factors to be compared including the t iming/ period of comparison; analytical information about the taxpayer regarding comparative factors on functions, assets and risks; product characteristics; contractual conditions; economic conditions when the transaction arose, and an analysis of the industry, market, business operational context, t rading of goods and provision of services and the assets of the parties all need to be conducted in order to f ix the price of the related transaction in accordance with the provisions of this Decree;
An assessment and search for comparables includes priority review of internal independent comparables on the basis of verifying the reliability and independence of these objects, ensuring that they do not involve transactions which fail to follow the principles o n independent t ransactions; formulating criteria for searching and identifying reliable database sources which can be used in accordance with the provisions of article 17 to search for similar independent comparables. On the basis of the information which has been analysed and reviewed regarding the availability of independent comparable data, then a transfer pricing method should be selected depending on the nature of the business and commercial operations and the financial and risk factors of the related parties in order to fix the price of the transaction;
An analysis of the level of similarity and reliability of the independent comparables which have b een selected is conducted on the basis of a review and screening of the qualitative and quantitative criteria; an analysis of economic information, industry and financial data about the selected objects to verify their similarity; and an identification of material differences and an adjustment of same. After selection of similar independent comparables, the data and financial figures on such comparables i s used to determine the bases for adjusting the price, profit ratio or profit split ratio of the taxpayer in accordance with article 8 above.

A determination of the price level, profit rate or profit split ratio is made b ased on the results of analysing the independent comparables to provide the basis for determining the CIT liab ilit y of the taxpayer without reducing the tax obligation payable to the State budget. The calculation method must be uniformly applied throughout the business and production cycle and phases in compliance with the business functions and models prescribed in articles 12, 13, 14 and 15 of this Decree.
Article 12 Selection of transfer pricing method
The methods of comparing and fixing the price of the related transaction (abbreviated to t ransfer pricing methods) must be applied in conformity with the principles of independent transactions, the nature of the transaction and the function of the taxpayer, and on the basis of uniform calculation and application throughout the entire business and production cycle and phases, and is based on the financial data of the independent comparables selected in accordance with the principles for comparability analysis stipulated in articles 6 to 10 inclusive of this Decree. The transfer pricing method to be selected shall be one of the methods prescribed in articles, 13, 14 and 15 of this Decree, based on the special characteristics of the related transaction, and on the available information and data.
Article 13	Method of comparing the price of the related transaction with the prices of independent transactions [comparable uncontrolled price method or CUP]
Cases when the CUP method is applied comprise:
The taxpayer conducted the related transaction for each type of goods, of tangible assets or of services with conditions regarding trading and common circulation on the market or at a price announced on domestic and international commodity and services markets; the t ransaction was payment of royalties when exploiting tangible assets; or it was the payment of loan interest duri ng lending and borrowing activities; or the taxpayer also conducts independent transactions and conducted the related transaction for products with the same product characteristics and on the same contractual conditions.
Principles of application:
The comparable uncontrolled price method is applied on the principle that there are no differences in product characteristics and the contractual conditions when comparing the price of uncontrolled transactions and that of the related transaction which have a material affect on the price of the product. If there are material differences affecting product prices, then such d if ferences must be eliminated;
Product characteristics and contractual terms which have a material effect on product prices comprise: the characteristics, quality, brand or trade name of the product, and the size and volume of transactions; the contractual conditions for supply and deliver of the p roduct namely the volume, delivery time and payment time and other contractual terms; the right to distribute and sell g oods, services and assets affecting their economic value and the market where the transactions took place, and any other factors affecting product prices such as economic conditions and operational function of the taxpayer.
Determination method:
The [unit] price of the product in a related transaction shall be adjusted to the product prices in the independent transactions or to a price within the standard arms' length range of the independent transactions in accordance with the provisions of this Decree;
If the product price has been announced on domestic and international commodity and services trading floors, then the product price in the related transaction is determined as the product price announced at the same time and on the same trading conditions;

A taxpayer purchasing machinery and equipment from a related party overseas must have data and source vouchers proving the standard purchase price in accordance with the arms' length principle as at the time of purchase: in the case of new machinery and equipment, the comparable price is the price in the invoice for purchase by the related party from an independent party; and in the case of second-hand machinery and equipment, there must be an original invoice and/or source voucher as at the time of purchase when the asset price was redetermined in accordance with current provisions of law guiding management, use and depreciation of fixed assets.
The result of determining such price of the related transaction shall be the taxable price for the purposes of declaring and assessing the amount of CIT payable, which must not reduce the amount of tax payable by the taxpayer to the state budget.
Article 14	Method of comparing the profit ratio of the taxpayer with profit ratios of independent comparables [transactional net margin method or TNNM]
Cases when the TNNM method is applied comprise:
The taxpayer does not have a database and information in order to apply the CUP method stipulated in article 13; or the taxpayer is unable to compare product transactions on the basis of comparing each transaction with another similar transaction, because the agglomeration of transactions is aimed at compliance with the nature and actual conduct of business and accordingly a profit margin of independent comparables must be selected, or the taxpayer does not perform any independent function reg ard ing the entire production and business chain, or does not participate in conduct of related transactions as prescribed in article 15 below, and in particular:
The method of comparing gross profit margin over turnover (the resale price method) applies if the taxpayer sells or redistributes products purchased from a related party to independent customers and does not create any intangible asset associated with the product sold, and the taxpayer d oes no t participate in the process of DEMPE of an intangible asset owned by the related party by selling the products or it does not conduct any processing or assembly in o rder to change the nature and characteristics of the products or their brand name in order to increase value. The resale price method does not apply to a taxpayer who is a distributor owning a valuable intangible asset of the Group regarding brand name, trade mark or any other intangible asset relating to marketing such as lists of customers, distribution channels, logos, images and other brand identifiers for market research purposes or promotion activities, or does not incur costs for creating and designing such distribution channels, brand identifiers or does not incur other after-sales expenses;
The method of comparing the ratio of gross profit over cost price (the cost plus profit method) applies if the taxpayer does not own any intangible assets and incurs few business risks, and p erforms the manufacturing or production function pursuant to a contract or order placed for goods, or processes or assembles the products or installs equipment or purchases and supplies products; or the taxpayer provides services to or conducts R&D for the related party pursuant to a contract. This cost plus profit method does not apply to a taxpayer which is a self-reliant manufacturer or which exercises the function of product R&D in order to formulate brand names o r t rademarks of goods, or market strategies or to provide product warranties and customer care;
The method of comparing net profit ratios [comparable profit method] applies if the taxpayer does not have information in order to apply the method of comparing the price of independent transactions; o r lacks data and information about the accounting methods of the independent comparables or is unable to find such comparables with similar functions and products and therefore is unable to apply the method of comparing the ratio of gross profit over cost price (the cost plus profit method); or the taxpayer performs distribution or production functions but without owning intangible assets or without participating in the development, enhancement, maintenance, protection and exploitation [DEMPE] of

intangible assets or does not fall within the cases for application of the method of profit split between the related parties as prescribed in article 15.1.
Principles for application:
The method of comparing profit ratios is applied on the principle that there is no difference regarding operational functions, assets and risks; that the economic conditions and cost accounting method when making the comparison between the taxpayer and independent comparables have a material impact on the profit rate/margin. If there are material differences affecting the profit rate, then such differences must be eliminated.
Factors which have a material impact on the profit rate comprise factors regarding assets, capital and costs; controlling and decision-making power in practice and serving implementation of the main functions of the taxpayer; the nature of the business line in which business is conducted and the nature of the production and consumption markets; the cost accounting method and cost structure of the product; the economic  conditions  in which the transaction took place; the commercial and f inancial relationships of the multi-national Group; technical assistance; the sharing of business know-how; the secondment of or part-time personal and the economic conditions of the taxpayer's business line or industry, and the special characteristics of the product and the contractual conditions;
The resale price method is applied when differences may materially affect the gross profit selling rate (net revenue) such as costs which reflect the function of the enterprise as a selling agent, exclusive distributor or distributor conducting marketing; the growth rate of the product consumption market; the function of the taxpayer in the supply chain such as retail or wholesale, and the cost accounting methods of the parties;
If the cost plus interest method is applied, then differences which may materially affect the gross profit-cost ratio comprise costs ref lecting the business functions of the enterprise such as manufacturing pursuant to contracts appointed by the parent company or providing services internally within the Group; contractual obligations such as the deadline for product delivery; costs of q uality control and of storage, payment conditions and cost accounting methods applicable to the constituent factors of the cost price of the taxpayer and those of independent comparables;
If the method of comparing net profit ratios is applied, then differences which may materially affect net profit margins are differences in operating functions, assets, and risks; e conomic conditions; contractual conditions and product characteristics as prescribed in article 10. If the taxpayer conducts business with simple production and distribution functions without the function of making strategic decisions or of developing transactions which add value, does not bear inventory risks o r market risks and does not generate revenue or expenses from the exploitation of intangible assets, then the taxpayer should not bear losses from such risks arising during production and business activities.
Determination method:
The method of comparing rate of return using the gross margin or net profit rate of selected independent comparables is used to determine the corresponding gross margin or net profit marg in of the taxpayer. Selection of the rate of return including gross margin or net profit margin o n revenue, costs o r assets depends on the substance/nature and economic conditions of the transaction and the functions of the taxpayer, and the cost accounting methods of the parties. The basis for determining the profit rates is the taxpayer's accounting data on revenue, expenses and assets which are not controlled o r decided by the related parties:
The method of comparing gross profit margin over turnover (the resale price method):
The buy-in price of the goods, services or assets (cost price) from the related party equals (=) selling price (net turnover) of such goods, services or assets resold to an independent party less (-) gross profit over the

selling price (net turnover) of the taxpayer less (-) a number of other expenses included in the buy-in price namely import duty, customs fees, insurance costs and international freight (if any).
Gross profit over selling price (net turnover) of the taxpayer is determined from independent comparables and equals (=) selling price (net turnover) of the taxpayer multiplied by (x) gross profit rate over the selling price (net turnover) of the selected independent comparables.
The ratio of gross profit (net turnover) of the selected independent comparables is a price within the standard arms' length range of such gross profit ratios over selling price (net turnover) of the selected independent comparables, used to adjust [the taxpayer's price] for consistency with the principles stipulated in this Decree.
The buy-in price from the related party (or cost price) as adjusted in accordance with the independent comparables is the price for assessing tax, for declaring expenses and for determining the amount of CIT payable by the taxpayer.
The method of comparing the ratio of gross profit over cost price (the cost price plus profit method):
The selling price or net turnover of the goods, services or assets sold to the related party is determined as equal to (=) cost price of the goods, services or assets purchased from an independent party plus (+) profit over cost price of the taxpayer.
Gross profit over cost price of the taxpayer is determined from independent comparables as equal to (=) cost price of the taxpayer multiplied by (x) ratio of profit over cost price of the selected independent comparables.
The ratios of gross profit over cost price of the selected independent comparables is a value within the standard arms' length range of the ratios of gross profit o ver cost p rice of the selected independent comparables used to make the appropriate adjustment in compliance with the principles stipulated in this Decree.
The selling price to the related party (or net turnover) adjusted in accordance with the independent comparables shall be the price for tax assessment purposes, for declaration of expenses and for fixing the amount of CIT payable by the taxpayer.
The method of comparing net profit ratios:
The net profit ratio pre-loan interest fees and pre-CIT on revenue, expenses or assets of the taxpayer conducting the related transaction is adjusted in accordance with the net profit ratios pre-loan interest fees on revenue, expenses or assets of the selected independent comparables, as the basis for adjusting and f ixing the tax obligations of the taxpayer.
Net profit does not include the difference between turnover and expenses of financial activities.
The net profit ratios selected are a value within the standard arms' length range of the net profit ratios of the selected independent comparables in order to adjust and determine taxable income and the amount of tax payable by the taxpayer in compliance with the principles stipulated in this Decree.
Criteria on pre-loan interest fees and pre-CIT net profit ratios are determined in accordance with the provisions of the law on accounting and the law on management of tax and CIT.
The result of determining the amended net profit ratio of the taxpayer is the basis for determining the amount of taxable income and the amount of CIT payable without reducing the tax obligation of the taxpayer owed to the State budget.
Article 15 The method of profit split between the related parties
Cases when this method is applied comprise:

The taxpayer participates in conducting a combined related transaction of a special, unique and secret (closed) nature within the Group, in activities being development of new p roducts, using exclusive technology for participating in a value chain of monopoly [exclusive] t ransactions of the Group or in the development, enhancement, maintenance, protection and exploitation [D EMPE] of monopoly [exclusive] intangible assets, without any basis for determining the price as b etween the related parties, or simultaneously conducts complex financial transactions related to multiple wo rld f inancial markets;
The taxpayer participates in digital economy related transactions without any basis for determining the price as between the related parties;
The taxpayer implements its own sovereign [autonomous] function throughout the entire production and business process and is not an applicable entity as prescribed in articles 13.1 or 14.1.
Principles of application:
The profit split method means allocation of total profit of the related transactions to determine the p rofit of the taxpayer participating in the transaction chain. This method is applicable to the total actual p rofit plus potential profit determined from financial figures provided from valid and appropriate source vouchers; and the value and profit of the related transactions must be determined by the same acco unting method throughout the entire period of applying the profit split method.
Determination method:
The adjusted profit of the taxpayer is allocated from the total profit from the related transactions comprising actual profit and potential profit collectable by the parties participating in such transaction chain.
The adjusted profit of the taxpayer includes total basic profit plus extra profit. Basic profit is d etermined in accordance with the method of comparing profit ratios prescribed in article 14. Extra profit is determined as a ratio allocated on one or more factors such as revenue, expenses, assets or manpower o f the related parties to the transaction and in compliance with the arms' length principle.
If there is insufficient information and databases to make an adjusted allocation of profit as prescribed above, then allocation may be based on one or more factors such as revenue, expenses, assets or manpower of the related parties to the transactions and in compliance with the arms' length principle.
The adjusted profit of the taxpayer is the basis for determining taxable income and the amount of CIT payable without reducing the amount of the tax payable by the taxpayer to the State budget.

Total loan interest expenses which are deductible when determining CIT of enterprises with related transactions:
Total loan expenses (after deducting interest income on deposits and lending) incurred in the period and which are deductible when determining taxable income for CIT purposes of the enterprise shall not exceed 30%6 of total net profit from business activities in the period plus interest expenses (after deducting interest income on deposits and lending) arising in the period and depreciation expenses in the period;
