CHAPTER 2
Analysis, Comparison and Selection of Independent Comparables and Methods for Fixing the
Price of a Related Transaction
Article 6 Principles for analysis and comparison
1. An analysis and comparison of a related transaction is undertaken on the principle of the real nature
of the operation or transaction [substance over form] in order to decide the tax obligation and to
identify the substance of the related transaction:
(a) A comparison is made between the legal contract or transaction agreement or document of the
related parties with the actual conduct by the parties. If a taxpayer has a related transaction but there
are no written agreements or if any existing written agreement is inconsistent with the independent
transaction principle [arms' length principle] or if the actual conduct of the transaction is inconsistent
with the arms' length principle between unrelated parties, then the related party transaction must be
determined in accordance with its true business nature as if between independent [non-related]
parties as follows: a related party receiving income or profit from a related transaction with a taxpayer
must have the ownership and business risk controlling right with respect to the assets, goods,
services, resources or rights with economic interests attached and must have the right to create
income from shareholding, share certificates and other financial instruments and the taxpayer
incurring expenses as a result of the transaction with the related party must receive actual benefits
and economic value or a contribution to the creation of turnover or added value to the production and
business activities of such taxpayer in compliance with the arms' length principle;
© Allens - Vietnam Laws Online Database on www.vietnamlaws.com 4
(b) The nature of the transaction is determined by the method of collating information, source vouchers
and data about the transaction and the risks of the related parties during the actual conduct of
production and business.
2. An analysis and comparison of the related transaction with independent transactions:
(a) The bases for comparing contracts, documents and agreements, and the economic, commercial and
financial relationship in a related transaction of the taxpayer are data and the actual conduct of the
transaction between the related parties in order to make a comparison of same with business
decisions which might be approved by independent parties in similar conditions. The principle on
comparison which is applied during analysis and comparison attaches more importance to the actual
substance and business practice and to the risks incurred by the related parties rather than to their
written agreements;
(b) A comparability analysis must ensure that there is a similarity between the independent comparables
and the related transaction, without material differences affecting the price level, profit ratio or profit
split ratio between the parties. If there are such material differences affecting such items, then there
must be a further analysis, determination and adjustment by eliminating the material differences from
the comparables via a comparison of the factors prescribed in articles 7 and 10 of this Decree and in
compliance with each method for fixing the price of a related transaction [transfer pricing method]
stipulated in articles 13, 14 and 15 of this Decree.
Article 7 Selection of independent comparables
1. Selection of internal independent comparables means selection of transactions between the taxpayer
and unrelated parties ensuring similarity and no material differences regarding price level, profit ratio
or profit split ratio between the parties. If there are no such similar internal independent comparables,
then comparables shall be chosen in accordance with sub-clauses (b) and (c) of article 17.3 of this
Decree. A comparison between a related transaction [the controlled transaction] and an independent
transaction [uncontrolled transaction] is conducted on the basis of comparing each transaction with
each similar product. If transactions are not able to be compared based on products, then the
agglomeration of transactions must ensure consistency regarding their nature/substance and actual
business practice, and a transfer pricing method prescribed in articles 12, 13, 14 and 15 of this
Decree must be applied.
2. Financial data of comparables must be reliable for use in declaring and assessing tax and must
comply with the regulations on accounting, statistics and taxation. The time [period] when the
comparable transactions were conducted must be the same as the time of the related transaction or
their fiscal year must the same as the fiscal year of the taxpayer, except in a special case when it is
necessary to extend the comparison period as prescribed in article 9 of this Decree. Data formats
must ensure that price levels are comparable and assessable as at the time of the transactions or
within the same tax assessment period; and data comparing profit ratios or profit split ratios must be
taken within at least three consecutive tax assessment periods. The taxpayer should round up value
ratios and corresponding ratios to the second digit after the decimal point. If relative figures are taken
from announced data which does not have absolute numbers attached and the relative figures have
not been rounded up, then these figures should be taken from data which has been announced and
which also cites its sources.
3. The minimum number of independent comparables to be selected after comparability analysis and
adjustment of material differences is as follows: one comparable if there is no difference between the
related transaction of the taxpayer conducting the related transaction and the independent
comparable; three comparables if there are differences between the comparables but there is
sufficient information and data for eliminating the material differences; and five comparables if there
© Allens - Vietnam Laws Online Database on www.vietnamlaws.com 5
is only information and data for eliminating most of the material differences between the independent
comparables.
Article 8 Adjusting price levels, profit ratios and profit split ratios of the taxpayer
1. In a case of looking at independent comparables with equal reliability and with no differences, or with
differences but with enough information and data to provide the basis for excluding important
differences:
(a) If the price level, profit ratio or profit split ratio of the taxpayer is within the range of independent
transactions' value (arms' length range) of the comparables, then the taxpayer is not required to
adjust the price level, profit ratio or profit split ratio in order to fix the price of the related transaction;
(b) If the price level, profit ratio or profit split ratio of the taxpayer is not within the arms' length range of
the comparables, then the taxpayer must determine a value/price within the arms' length range which
reflects the highest degree of similarity to the related transaction in order to adjust the price level,
profit ratio or profit split ratio of the related transaction but without reducing taxable income or the tax
obligation owed by the taxpayer to the State budget.
2. If there is only data information providing the basis to eliminate most of the material differences of the
independent comparables, then at least five independent comparables must be selected and the
standard arm's length range shall be applied in accordance with the guidelines in Appendix 54 issued
with this Decree. The selection of a value/price within the standard arm's length range in order to
adjust and re-determine the price level, profit ratio or profit split ratio of the taxpayer is made as
following:
(a) If the price level, profit ratio or profit split ratio of the taxpayer is a value/price within the standard
arm's length range of the similar independent comparables, then the taxpayer is not required to
amend its price level, profit ratio or profit split ratio in order to fix the price of the related transaction;
(b) If the price level, profit ratio or profit split ratio of the taxpayer is a value/price not within the standard
arm's length range of the similar independent comparables, then the taxpayer must determine a
value within the standard arm's length range which reflects the highest degree of similarity with the
related transaction in order to amend the price level, profit ratio or profit split ratio of the related
transaction and to fix taxable income and the amount of tax payable without reducing such taxable
income or tax obligation payable to the State budget;
(c) If the tax office amends or fixes the price level, profit ratio or profit split ratio of the taxpayer, then the
adjusted or fixed price/value shall be the median value of the standard arm's length range.
3. Based on the transfer pricing method and the selected independent comparables, an amendment
shall be made to the price level, profit ratio or profit split ratio of the taxpayer in order to fix the
corporate income tax [CIT] obligation of the taxpayer without reducing the amount of the tax
obligation owing to the State budget.
Article 9 Expanding the scope of analysis and comparison
1. If a related transaction is unique or has special characteristics so that independent comparables are
unable to be found in order to conduct a comparison, then the scope of the comparative analysis
shall be expanded in terms of the industry, geographical markets and period of comparison in order
to find independent comparables. Such expansion of the scope of the comparative analysis shall be
carried out as follows:
(a) Selection of independent comparables in accordance with the statistical economic sub-sector with
the highest similarity to the taxpayer's sub-sector of operation in the same local or domestic market;
4 Allens footnote: The Appendices have not been translated.
© Allens - Vietnam Laws Online Database on www.vietnamlaws.com 6
(b) Expansion of the comparative geographical area to regional countries which have similar industry
conditions and a similar level of economic development.
2. If there is an expansion of the scope of analysis and selection of independent comparables to the
above-mentioned geographical areas, then there must be an analysis of the significant qualitative
and quantitative differences in accordance with articles 10.6 and 14 of this Decree or use must be
made of figures and data of the independent comparables in the previous year while making
adjustments for the time factor difference (if any).
The extended time for selecting figures and data of independent comparables shall not exceed one fiscal
year compared to the fiscal year of the taxpayer if using the transfer pricing method prescribed in article 14
of this Decree [transactional net margin method].
Article 10 Criteria for analysing, comparing and adjusting material differences.
1. An analysis and comparison applying the method of comparing, reviewing and adjusting material
differences of the independent comparables comprises a consideration of the special characteristics
of the goods, services or assets (hereinafter abbreviated as product characteristics); operational
functions, assets, and production and business risks5; contractual conditions and the economic
conditions in which the transaction took place.
2. Product characteristics means characteristics or properties which affect the price of a product
comprising tangible characteristics such as physical properties, product quality, the brand or trade
name of the product, its reliability, availability and volume/quantity offered; service characteristics
such as nature/substance, complexity, expertise and scope of the services; intangible asset
characteristics such as the form of transfer, type of asset/property, form of ownership, term [of
ownership], degree of ownership protection, term of transfer, rights to be transferred and benefits
obtained from using the intangible assets.
(a) An analysis of intangible assets and distribution of profit to the related parties is based not only on
legal ownership also on all activities of risk management and the financial capacity to manage risks
during the entire process of development, enhancement, maintenance, protection and exploitation
[DEMPE] of the intangible assets as between the related parties. This analysis and comparison are
based on a number of characteristics of intangible assets such as any monopoly, the scope and term
of legal protection of the assets; rights established pursuant to a protection title, licence or written
transfer of rights in the intangible assets; the geographical scope/extent of the rights to the intangible
assets, their life cycle, developmental stage; the right to increase their value, change and update
such intangible assets; and the forecast profitability of the intangible assets;
(b) An analysis of the special characteristics of intangible assets includes a determination of which
assets are used or transferred during a transaction, and specific and material economic risks relevant
to their DEMPE; an identification of agreements reached in contracts such as legal ownership of the
intangible assets, the terms and conditions of such legal agreements; registration, agreements on
licensing and related contracts and on risks attached; an identification of the party performing the
function of exploitation and use of the assets and risk management regarding their DEMPE; an
identification of contractual terms and conditions and the actual practice of the parties; an
identification of the actual nature of the related transaction relevant to DEMPE of the intangible
assets when considering their legal ownership and relationships, rights pursuant to relevant
contracts, the actual conduct by the parties and a determination of the price/value of the transaction
5 Allens footnote: The OECD transfer pricing guidelines state that regard must be had to what the taxpayer obtained in return
for the functions it performed, the assets it used, and the risks it assumed.
© Allens - Vietnam Laws Online Database on www.vietnamlaws.com 7
consistent with the parties' contribution, actual functions performed, assets used and risks actually
assumed by the parties.
3. The following are analysed namely the operational function, assets, and production and business
risks performed by each party and the assets, production and business risks in relation to opportunity
costs, economic and industry conditions, operational sector and geographical location of the
taxpayer, such items to be analysed in order to identify factors reflecting the taxpayer's ability to profit
from the business operation and the actual business practice conducted by the taxpayer associated
with functions and use of the relevant assets, capital and costs.
The results of an analysis reflect the main function in the relationship between the use of the various types
of assets, capital and opportunity costs such as the risks associated with investment in such assets, capital
and costs with the ability to take profit as performed by the taxpayer regarding the business transaction and
in particular:
(a) Some of the main functions of the enterprise are analysed throughout the entire value chain of the
Group including research and development [R&D] such as providing R&D services pursuant to a
contract or autonomous R&D; technical development and product design; production or manufacture
including autonomous production, licensed production, processing pursuant to a contract or
outsourcing, and installation of equipment; trading and managing raw materials and other trading
activities; distribution including autonomous distribution, limited risk distribution, commission agency,
wholesale or retail distribution; provision of support services such as legal, financial accounting, debt
collection, personnel training, and maintenance; provision of transport or storage services;
conducting brand development activities such as marketing, advertising, market research or
exercising other functions throughout the industry value chain;
(b) Some of the main assets of the enterprise comprise intangible assets such as technical know-how,
copyright, business know-how, secret formulae, patents, and intangible assets relevant to
commercial and marketing activities such as brand names, system building and brand identity;
customer lists, data and relationships; tangible assets such as factories, machinery and equipment;
and financial assets and economic interests and benefits derived from such assets during the course
of their exploitation, use and transfer;
(c) Some of the main risks while conducting business include strategic or market risks resulting from
implementing business strategies such as market entry, market maintenance or market expansion;
infrastructure or inventory/storage risks; financial risks such as credit risks, bad debts and exchange
rate risks; transaction risks such as price factors and terms and conditions on payment during
commercial transactions; product risks arising from developmental design and production up until
quality control and after-sales service; business risks from capital investment, the volume of
customers, and risks of force majeure events.
An analysis of the business risks of the taxpayer throughout the entire value chain of the Group is aimed at
identifying major risks to the entire industry value chain, and the ability to control risks such as making risk
management decisions and dealing with the risks when they actually occur comprising identification of key
economic risks; an assessment of the level of risk allocation and settlement in the legal contracts or
agreements of the taxpayer; an analysis of the function of risk control and risk mitigation stipulated in legal
contracts or written agreements; and a check and review of the actual status of implementation and how
the taxpayer's risks were actually allocated and borne. If there are differences between the risk allocation
stipulated in legal contracts or written agreements as compared to the actual conduct of the parties, then
based on the results of this risk analysis the tax office shall reallocate risks and adjust the tax payer's price
level, profit ratio and/or profit split ratio.
4. The contractual terms and conditions when conducting the transaction comprise terms and
conditions on volume, trading conditions or product distribution; time, conditions and method of
© Allens - Vietnam Laws Online Database on www.vietnamlaws.com 8
payment; conditions on warranty, replacement, upgrade, amendment or modification to products;
conditions on exclusive rights to trade and distribute the products; and a number of other conditions
which could have an economic affect such as support services, consultancy on quality control, use
guidelines, and support for advertising and promotion.
(a) If the terms and conditions of the legal contract or written agreement between the parties do not fully
reflect their actual practice, then there must be an analysis and comparison of such actual conduct or
of the financial data in order to determine the characteristics, economic substance and actual
business risks incurred by the parties;
(b) If the related parties did not sign a legal contract or written agreement and do not recognize revenue
and expenses such as technical assistance, assistance of the Group, sharing business know-how or
secondment/part-time use of personnel, then an analysis must be conducted in order to determine
the substance of the transaction, its value, the income generated from it and the contribution made
by each of the related parties. On such basis, a comparison may be made with business decisions
which would be acceptable by independent parties in similar conditions in order to redefine the
related transaction of the taxpayer.
5. Economic conditions of the transaction and market conditions as at the time the transaction arose
which could impact the price, profit ratio or profit split ratio.
(a) A number of economic conditions existing when the transaction took place such as the size and
geographical position of the production and consumption markets, and the market level such as
whether it was wholesale, normal retail or exclusive distribution; the product's competitiveness in the
market and the relative competitive positions of the seller and buyer; the availability of substitute
goods; the level of supply and demand in the market generally and in each specific area, and the
purchasing power of consumers; economic factors affecting the costs of production and business
existing in the location where the transaction took place such as policies on tax incentives, and the
market regulation policies of the Government; production costs, land costs, labour and capital costs;
the business cycle and factors with a positive effect on the taxpayer's price level, profit ratio or profit
split ratio such as characteristics regarding the location, advantages and cost savings based on
geographical, market and local characteristics and also on the workforce, concentration of synergy
functions and specialized or expert contribution made by the related parties in creating value;
(b) If the taxpayer and the comparables do not reside in the same country or territory, or do not provide
goods and services in the same geographical market, then an analysis of the economic conditions
shall comprise an analysis of the degree of similarity between the markets where the taxpayer on the
one hand resides and such comparables on the other hand reside with respect to comparative
advantages, and location affecting comparative factors such as the cost of labour, cost of raw
materials, transport, land rent, expenses for training and assistance, any incentives regarding
finance, tax and infrastructure costs, growth level of the markets and market advantages such as
population numbers and numbers of customers with good spending power and any other comparable
advantages.
6. A comparability analysis and elimination of material differences means an analysis and elimination of
both qualitative and quantitative differences of information or financial figures which have a major
impact on the factors used as the basis for determining the price of the related transaction in
accordance with each of the pricing methods prescribed in articles 13, 14 and 15 of this Decree.
Quantitative differences mean differences determined by absolute numbers regarding the business
cycle, and the number of years for which the enterprise has been established and operating, or by
relative numbers such as differences in financial indicators according to the characteristics of the
investment industry or operational function, and differences regarding working capital; while
qualitative differences mean information determined and based on each method for fixing the price of
the related transaction as prescribed in articles 13, 14 and 15 of this Decree.
© Allens - Vietnam Laws Online Database on www.vietnamlaws.com 9
(a) Information determined to be critical comprises differences regarding product characteristics,
contractual conditions, functions, assets, risks, the business industry or trade, and economic
conditions of the taxpayer and of the independent comparables; differences regarding policies and
the investment environment, and the input costs of production and business in local, domestic and
overseas areas;
(b) Quantitative and qualitative differences must be reviewed and adjusted as corresponding to the
comparative factors with a critical impact on the transfer pricing methods stipulated in articles 13, 14
and 15 of this Decree.
7. The results of analysis provide the basis for selecting independent comparables appropriate for each
transfer pricing method stipulated in articles 13, 14 and 15 of this Decree. If the taxpayer fails to
adjust the price, profit rate or profit split ratio in accordance with the independent comparables for the
reason that qualitative and quantitative differences cause a material impact, then the taxpayer must
search and reselect independent comparables in order to determine a standard arms' length range
ensuring reliability, uniformity and an adjustment of the price of the related transaction in accordance
with the provisions of this Decree.
Article 11 Sequence for analysis and comparison
1. Identification of the substance/nature of the related transaction before conducting an analysis of its
similarity with independent comparables.
2. Analysis, comparison, search and selection of similar independent comparables on the basis of
determining the comparison time, the product characteristics and the contractual conditions; an
analysis of the industry, market and economic conditions where and when the transaction arose; an
analysis of the related transaction and of the taxpayer conducting it; an identification of the database
source, of the transfer pricing method and adjustment of material differences, and in particular:
(a) A determination of the scope, contents and factors to be compared including the timing/period of
comparison; analytical information about the taxpayer regarding comparative factors on functions,
assets and risks; product characteristics; contractual conditions; economic conditions when the
transaction arose, and an analysis of the industry, market, business operational context, trading of
goods and provision of services and the assets of the parties all need to be conducted in order to fix
the price of the related transaction in accordance with the provisions of this Decree;
(b) An assessment and search for comparables includes priority review of internal independent
comparables on the basis of verifying the reliability and independence of these objects, ensuring that
they do not involve transactions which fail to follow the principles on independent transactions;
formulating criteria for searching and identifying reliable database sources which can be used in
accordance with the provisions of article 17 to search for similar independent comparables. On the
basis of the information which has been analysed and reviewed regarding the availability of
independent comparable data, then a transfer pricing method should be selected depending on the
nature of the business and commercial operations and the financial and risk factors of the related
parties in order to fix the price of the transaction;
(c) An analysis of the level of similarity and reliability of the independent comparables which have been
selected is conducted on the basis of a review and screening of the qualitative and quantitative
criteria; an analysis of economic information, industry and financial data about the selected objects to
verify their similarity; and an identification of material differences and an adjustment of same. After
selection of similar independent comparables, the data and financial figures on such comparables is
used to determine the bases for adjusting the price, profit ratio or profit split ratio of the taxpayer in
accordance with article 8 above.

3. A determination of the price level, profit rate or profit split ratio is made based on the results of
analysing the independent comparables to provide the basis for determining the CIT liability of the
taxpayer without reducing the tax obligation payable to the State budget. The calculation method
must be uniformly applied throughout the business and production cycle and phases in compliance
with the business functions and models prescribed in articles 12, 13, 14 and 15 of this Decree.
Article 12 Selection of transfer pricing method
The methods of comparing and fixing the price of the related transaction (abbreviated to transfer pricing
methods) must be applied in conformity with the principles of independent transactions, the nature of the
transaction and the function of the taxpayer, and on the basis of uniform calculation and application
throughout the entire business and production cycle and phases, and is based on the financial data of the
independent comparables selected in accordance with the principles for comparability analysis stipulated in
articles 6 to 10 inclusive of this Decree. The transfer pricing method to be selected shall be one of the
methods prescribed in articles, 13, 14 and 15 of this Decree, based on the special characteristics of the
related transaction, and on the available information and data.
Article 13 Method of comparing the price of the related transaction with the prices of independent
transactions [comparable uncontrolled price method or CUP]
1. Cases when the CUP method is applied comprise:
The taxpayer conducted the related transaction for each type of goods, of tangible assets or of
services with conditions regarding trading and common circulation on the market or at a price
announced on domestic and international commodity and services markets; the transaction was
payment of royalties when exploiting tangible assets; or it was the payment of loan interest during
lending and borrowing activities; or the taxpayer also conducts independent transactions and
conducted the related transaction for products with the same product characteristics and on the
same contractual conditions.
2. Principles of application:
(a) The comparable uncontrolled price method is applied on the principle that there are no differences in
product characteristics and the contractual conditions when comparing the price of uncontrolled
transactions and that of the related transaction which have a material affect on the price of the
product. If there are material differences affecting product prices, then such differences must be
eliminated;
(b) Product characteristics and contractual terms which have a material effect on product prices
comprise: the characteristics, quality, brand or trade name of the product, and the size and volume of
transactions; the contractual conditions for supply and deliver of the product namely the volume,
delivery time and payment time and other contractual terms; the right to distribute and sell goods,
services and assets affecting their economic value and the market where the transactions took place,
and any other factors affecting product prices such as economic conditions and operational function
of the taxpayer.
3. Determination method:
(c) The [unit] price of the product in a related transaction shall be adjusted to the product prices in the
independent transactions or to a price within the standard arms' length range of the independent
transactions in accordance with the provisions of this Decree;
(d) If the product price has been announced on domestic and international commodity and services
trading floors, then the product price in the related transaction is determined as the product price
announced at the same time and on the same trading conditions;
© Allens - Vietnam Laws Online Database on www.vietnamlaws.com 11
(e) A taxpayer purchasing machinery and equipment from a related party overseas must have data and
source vouchers proving the standard purchase price in accordance with the arms' length principle
as at the time of purchase: in the case of new machinery and equipment, the comparable price is the
price in the invoice for purchase by the related party from an independent party; and in the case of
second-hand machinery and equipment, there must be an original invoice and/or source voucher as
at the time of purchase when the asset price was redetermined in accordance with current provisions
of law guiding management, use and depreciation of fixed assets.
4. The result of determining such price of the related transaction shall be the taxable price for the
purposes of declaring and assessing the amount of CIT payable, which must not reduce the amount
of tax payable by the taxpayer to the state budget.
Article 14 Method of comparing the profit ratio of the taxpayer with profit ratios of independent
comparables [transactional net margin method or TNNM]
1. Cases when the TNNM method is applied comprise:
The taxpayer does not have a database and information in order to apply the CUP method stipulated in
article 13; or the taxpayer is unable to compare product transactions on the basis of comparing each
transaction with another similar transaction, because the agglomeration of transactions is aimed at
compliance with the nature and actual conduct of business and accordingly a profit margin of independent
comparables must be selected, or the taxpayer does not perform any independent function regarding the
entire production and business chain, or does not participate in conduct of related transactions as
prescribed in article 15 below, and in particular:
(a) The method of comparing gross profit margin over turnover (the resale price method) applies if the
taxpayer sells or redistributes products purchased from a related party to independent customers and
does not create any intangible asset associated with the product sold, and the taxpayer does not
participate in the process of DEMPE of an intangible asset owned by the related party by selling the
products or it does not conduct any processing or assembly in order to change the nature and
characteristics of the products or their brand name in order to increase value. The resale price
method does not apply to a taxpayer who is a distributor owning a valuable intangible asset of the
Group regarding brand name, trade mark or any other intangible asset relating to marketing such as
lists of customers, distribution channels, logos, images and other brand identifiers for market
research purposes or promotion activities, or does not incur costs for creating and designing such
distribution channels, brand identifiers or does not incur other after-sales expenses;
(b) The method of comparing the ratio of gross profit over cost price (the cost plus profit method) applies
if the taxpayer does not own any intangible assets and incurs few business risks, and performs the
manufacturing or production function pursuant to a contract or order placed for goods, or processes
or assembles the products or installs equipment or purchases and supplies products; or the taxpayer
provides services to or conducts R&D for the related party pursuant to a contract. This cost plus profit
method does not apply to a taxpayer which is a self-reliant manufacturer or which exercises the
function of product R&D in order to formulate brand names or trademarks of goods, or market
strategies or to provide product warranties and customer care;
(c) The method of comparing net profit ratios [comparable profit method] applies if the taxpayer does not
have information in order to apply the method of comparing the price of independent transactions; or
lacks data and information about the accounting methods of the independent comparables or is
unable to find such comparables with similar functions and products and therefore is unable to apply
the method of comparing the ratio of gross profit over cost price (the cost plus profit method); or the
taxpayer performs distribution or production functions but without owning intangible assets or without
participating in the development, enhancement, maintenance, protection and exploitation [DEMPE] of
© Allens - Vietnam Laws Online Database on www.vietnamlaws.com 12
intangible assets or does not fall within the cases for application of the method of profit split between
the related parties as prescribed in article 15.1.
2. Principles for application:
(a) The method of comparing profit ratios is applied on the principle that there is no difference regarding
operational functions, assets and risks; that the economic conditions and cost accounting method
when making the comparison between the taxpayer and independent comparables have a material
impact on the profit rate/margin. If there are material differences affecting the profit rate, then such
differences must be eliminated.
Factors which have a material impact on the profit rate comprise factors regarding assets, capital and
costs; controlling and decision-making power in practice and serving implementation of the main
functions of the taxpayer; the nature of the business line in which business is conducted and the
nature of the production and consumption markets; the cost accounting method and cost structure of
the product; the economic conditions in which the transaction took place; the commercial and
financial relationships of the multi-national Group; technical assistance; the sharing of business
know-how; the secondment of or part-time personal and the economic conditions of the taxpayer's
business line or industry, and the special characteristics of the product and the contractual
conditions;
(b) The resale price method is applied when differences may materially affect the gross profit selling rate
(net revenue) such as costs which reflect the function of the enterprise as a selling agent, exclusive
distributor or distributor conducting marketing; the growth rate of the product consumption market;
the function of the taxpayer in the supply chain such as retail or wholesale, and the cost accounting
methods of the parties;
(c) If the cost plus interest method is applied, then differences which may materially affect the gross
profit-cost ratio comprise costs reflecting the business functions of the enterprise such as
manufacturing pursuant to contracts appointed by the parent company or providing services internally
within the Group; contractual obligations such as the deadline for product delivery; costs of quality
control and of storage, payment conditions and cost accounting methods applicable to the constituent
factors of the cost price of the taxpayer and those of independent comparables;
(d) If the method of comparing net profit ratios is applied, then differences which may materially affect
net profit margins are differences in operating functions, assets, and risks; economic conditions;
contractual conditions and product characteristics as prescribed in article 10. If the taxpayer conducts
business with simple production and distribution functions without the function of making strategic
decisions or of developing transactions which add value, does not bear inventory risks or market
risks and does not generate revenue or expenses from the exploitation of intangible assets, then the
taxpayer should not bear losses from such risks arising during production and business activities.
3. Determination method:
The method of comparing rate of return using the gross margin or net profit rate of selected independent
comparables is used to determine the corresponding gross margin or net profit margin of the taxpayer.
Selection of the rate of return including gross margin or net profit margin on revenue, costs or assets
depends on the substance/nature and economic conditions of the transaction and the functions of the
taxpayer, and the cost accounting methods of the parties. The basis for determining the profit rates is the
taxpayer's accounting data on revenue, expenses and assets which are not controlled or decided by the
related parties:
(a) The method of comparing gross profit margin over turnover (the resale price method):
The buy-in price of the goods, services or assets (cost price) from the related party equals (=) selling price
(net turnover) of such goods, services or assets resold to an independent party less (-) gross profit over the
© Allens - Vietnam Laws Online Database on www.vietnamlaws.com 13
selling price (net turnover) of the taxpayer less (-) a number of other expenses included in the buy-in price
namely import duty, customs fees, insurance costs and international freight (if any).
Gross profit over selling price (net turnover) of the taxpayer is determined from independent comparables
and equals (=) selling price (net turnover) of the taxpayer multiplied by (x) gross profit rate over the selling
price (net turnover) of the selected independent comparables.
The ratio of gross profit (net turnover) of the selected independent comparables is a price within the
standard arms' length range of such gross profit ratios over selling price (net turnover) of the selected
independent comparables, used to adjust [the taxpayer's price] for consistency with the principles stipulated
in this Decree.
The buy-in price from the related party (or cost price) as adjusted in accordance with the independent
comparables is the price for assessing tax, for declaring expenses and for determining the amount of CIT
payable by the taxpayer.
(b) The method of comparing the ratio of gross profit over cost price (the cost price plus profit method):
The selling price or net turnover of the goods, services or assets sold to the related party is determined as
equal to (=) cost price of the goods, services or assets purchased from an independent party plus (+) profit
over cost price of the taxpayer.
Gross profit over cost price of the taxpayer is determined from independent comparables as equal to (=)
cost price of the taxpayer multiplied by (x) ratio of profit over cost price of the selected independent
comparables.
The ratios of gross profit over cost price of the selected independent comparables is a value within the
standard arms' length range of the ratios of gross profit over cost price of the selected independent
comparables used to make the appropriate adjustment in compliance with the principles stipulated in this
Decree.
The selling price to the related party (or net turnover) adjusted in accordance with the independent
comparables shall be the price for tax assessment purposes, for declaration of expenses and for fixing the
amount of CIT payable by the taxpayer.
(c) The method of comparing net profit ratios:
The net profit ratio pre-loan interest fees and pre-CIT on revenue, expenses or assets of the taxpayer
conducting the related transaction is adjusted in accordance with the net profit ratios pre-loan interest fees
on revenue, expenses or assets of the selected independent comparables, as the basis for adjusting and
fixing the tax obligations of the taxpayer.
Net profit does not include the difference between turnover and expenses of financial activities.
The net profit ratios selected are a value within the standard arms' length range of the net profit ratios of the
selected independent comparables in order to adjust and determine taxable income and the amount of tax
payable by the taxpayer in compliance with the principles stipulated in this Decree.
Criteria on pre-loan interest fees and pre-CIT net profit ratios are determined in accordance with the
provisions of the law on accounting and the law on management of tax and CIT.
4. The result of determining the amended net profit ratio of the taxpayer is the basis for determining the
amount of taxable income and the amount of CIT payable without reducing the tax obligation of the
taxpayer owed to the State budget.
Article 15 The method of profit split between the related parties
1. Cases when this method is applied comprise:
© Allens - Vietnam Laws Online Database on www.vietnamlaws.com 14
(a) The taxpayer participates in conducting a combined related transaction of a special, unique and
secret (closed) nature within the Group, in activities being development of new products, using
exclusive technology for participating in a value chain of monopoly [exclusive] transactions of the
Group or in the development, enhancement, maintenance, protection and exploitation [DEMPE] of
monopoly [exclusive] intangible assets, without any basis for determining the price as between the
related parties, or simultaneously conducts complex financial transactions related to multiple world
financial markets;
(b) The taxpayer participates in digital economy related transactions without any basis for determining
the price as between the related parties;
(c) The taxpayer implements its own sovereign [autonomous] function throughout the entire production
and business process and is not an applicable entity as prescribed in articles 13.1 or 14.1.
2. Principles of application:
The profit split method means allocation of total profit of the related transactions to determine the profit of
the taxpayer participating in the transaction chain. This method is applicable to the total actual profit plus
potential profit determined from financial figures provided from valid and appropriate source vouchers; and
the value and profit of the related transactions must be determined by the same accounting method
throughout the entire period of applying the profit split method.
3. Determination method:
The adjusted profit of the taxpayer is allocated from the total profit from the related transactions comprising
actual profit and potential profit collectable by the parties participating in such transaction chain.
The adjusted profit of the taxpayer includes total basic profit plus extra profit. Basic profit is determined in
accordance with the method of comparing profit ratios prescribed in article 14. Extra profit is determined as
a ratio allocated on one or more factors such as revenue, expenses, assets or manpower of the related
parties to the transaction and in compliance with the arms' length principle.
If there is insufficient information and databases to make an adjusted allocation of profit as prescribed
above, then allocation may be based on one or more factors such as revenue, expenses, assets or
manpower of the related parties to the transactions and in compliance with the arms' length principle.
4. The adjusted profit of the taxpayer is the basis for determining taxable income and the amount of CIT
payable without reducing the amount of the tax payable by the taxpayer to the State budget.
CHAPTER 3
Expenses for Tax Assessment Purposes, and Declaration and Determination of the Price/Value
of the Related Transaction
Article 16 Determining expenses for tax assessment purposes of an enterprise with a related transaction
1. Expenses of a related transaction which are inconsistent with the nature of independent transactions
or which do not contribute to the creation of turnover or income for the production and business
activities of the taxpayer are non-deductible expenses for purposes of assessing CIT within the
period, such non-deductible expenses comprising:
(a) Payments made to related parties which do not have any production or business activities related to
the industry and trade of the taxpayer or to the production and business activities of the taxpayer;
(b) Payments made to related parties with production and business activities but their assets size, staff

CIT, and/or do not contribute to the creation of turnover or added value for the business and
production activities of the taxpayer.
2. Provision of services as between related parties [intra-Group services]:
(a) Except for the expenses prescribed in sub-clause (b) below, a taxpayer may deduct the service
charge when assessing tax in any one period if all the following conditions are satisfied: the services
provided are of commercial, financial and economic value to, and directly served the production and
business activities of the taxpayer; intra-Group services shall only be determined as having been
provided when independent parties in similar circumstances would have paid for these services; the
service fees were paid on the arms' length principle and on the basis of calculating the price of
related transactions, or intra-Group allocation of the service fees must be uniformly applied
throughout the Group with respect to the equivalent type of services and the taxpayer must provide a
contract, source vouchers, invoices and information about the calculation method, the allocation
factors, and the Group's pricing policy on the services provided.
If intra-Group services relate to centres implementing specialized functions and combining efforts to
create added value for the Group [synergies], then the taxpayer must determine the total value
created from such functions and determine a level of profit allocation appropriate for the value of the
contribution made by the related parties after subtracting (-) the corresponding amount of service
fees for the related party performing the function of coordinating and providing the services in an
independent transaction of a similar nature.
(b) Service fees which are non-deductible when determining taxable income comprise: expenses arising
from services provided only for the purpose of serving the interests of or creating value for other
related parties; services serving the interests of shareholders of related parties; services with multiple
charges which a number of related parties provide with respect to the one type of services, and for
which added value for the taxpayer is unable to be determined; and services in the nature of services
for which the benefit received by the taxpayer is due to it being a member of the Group and the fees
are fees which a related party added to the services provided by a third party in the related party's
capacity as an intermediary without contributing additional value to such services.
3. Total loan interest expenses which are deductible when determining CIT of enterprises with related
transactions:
(a) Total loan expenses (after deducting interest income on deposits and lending) incurred in the period
and which are deductible when determining taxable income for CIT purposes of the enterprise shall
not exceed 30%6 of total net profit from business activities in the period plus interest expenses (after
deducting interest income on deposits and lending) arising in the period and depreciation expenses
in the period;
(b) That part of loan interest which is non-deductible pursuant to sub-clause (a) above shall be carried
forward to the next tax period to determine deductible loan interest expenses if the total loan interest
expenses to be deducted in the subsequent tax period are below the cap prescribed in sub-clause (a)
above. The time for carrying forward loan interest expenses is a maximum five (5) consecutive years
from the year following the year in which non-deductible loan interest expenses were incurred;
(c) The provisions in sub-clause (a) above do not apply to loans of taxpayers being credit institutions in
accordance with the Law on Credit Institutions or insurance business organizations pursuant to the
Law on Insurance Business; or to ODA loans, or preferential loans of a Government where the

billion VND, and applies the following pre-loan interest and pre-CIT net profit ratios over turnover in
the following sectors:
- Distribution: from five (5) per cent or more;
- Production: from ten (10) per cent or more;
- Processing: from fifteen (15) per cent or more.
If a taxpayer monitors and conducts cost accounting separately for revenue and expenses for each sector,
then the corresponding net profit margin without loan interest expenses and CIT on net revenue
corresponding to each sector shall apply.
If the taxpayer monitors and conducts separate cost accounting for revenue but not for the costs incurred in
each sector during its production and business operation, then it must allocate the expenses in accordance
with the turnover ratio of each sector in order to apply the net profit margin without interest expenses and
CIT on net turnover corresponding to each sector.
If the taxpayer fails to monitor and conduct separate cost accounting for revenue and expenses of each
sector of its production and business operation in order to determine the net profit margin without loan
interest expenses and the CIT corresponding to each sector, then it must apply the net profit margin without
interest expenses and CIT on net turnover of the sector with the highest such rates.
If a taxpayer does not apply the profit margin level regulated in this clause then it must prepare a file fixing
the price of related transactions in accordance with regulations.
3. In the case of taxpayers exempt from declaration and exempt from preparation of files prescribed in
clauses 1 and 2 above, the provisions in article 16.3 of this Decree apply to calculation of total loan
interest expenses which are deductible when determining CIT of such enterprise.
