regulation: the changes of the index leads to an increase or decrease of tax obligations;
- Taxpayer’s opinions on continuance and/or revision of APA’s terms and other related
issues (if any, e.g. including but not limited to new issues or related tax disputes).
3. Report per tax authority’s request
Taxpayer will supply information, documents or explain issues related to the implementation
of the APA to the tax authority within 30 days upon the receipt of tax authority’s written
request.
4. Ad-hoc report
In case where there are events which have material impacts on the continuance of the APA
implementation or on operating results and tax declaration of the taxpayer, the taxpayer will
report to tax authority within 30 days since the events happen (called ad-hoc report). Within 30
days from the date of receipt of the ad-hoc report, tax authority will respond to the taxpayer
and guide the taxpayer to implement suitable solutions to overcome such impacts (including
but not limited to make adjustment, supplement or terminate the APA).
5. In case during a unilateral APA, there is a double tax or adjustment on taxable income from tax
treaty partner which has adverse impacts on taxpayer, taxpayer will request competent tax
authority implement Mutual Agreement Procedure under Double Tax Agreement to solve such
disadvantages.
Article 18: Rights and obligations of tax authority
15
Translated by KPMG
1. Tax authority will supervise the implementation of APA of taxpayer on risk management
principle. The scope of an APA supervision includes:
a. Actual assessment of the compliance of APA’s terms (including transfer pricing methods);
b. Investigation of tax declaration and payment and adjustment of taxable income in
accordance with APA’s terms;
c. Investigation, assessment of information in periodic reports, ad-hoc reports reported by
taxpayer.
2. Tax authority’s supervision is not for APA’s re-evaluation or re-assessment purpose.
Article 19: Mutual Agreement Procedure
1. Taxpayer who is a tax resident of Vietnam and seeks for application of bilateral, multilateral
APA and needs tax authority’s support in the communication and promotion with tax treaty
partner to discuss, negotiate will submit Mutual Agreement Procedure request in accordance
with the relevant Double Tax Agreement according to Form 4/APA-MAP issued together with
this Circular, including:
a) Names, addresses, tax codes (if any) of the foreign taxpayers covered by the APA, the
relationships among parties covered by the APA (including organizational charts);
b) Name(s), address(es) of the tax treaty partner(s) where the foreign taxpayers declare and
pay tax;
c) Reasons for a bilateral or multilateral APA request;
d) Summary of reasons for seeking support;
đ) Relevant information, documents circulated by tax treaty partner (including but not limited
to: an announcement or decision on tax collection, tax obligation adjustment which may lead to
double taxation for incomes from related party transactions).
i) An APA request and information, data to submit to the General Department of Taxation in
accordance with regulations.
2. Within 30 days upon receipt of Mutual Agreement Procedure request and the formal APA
application, the General Department of Taxation’s competent tax authority will contact, discuss
with the competent tax authority of the tax treaty partner as stipulated under the article of
Mutual Agreement Procedure in accordance with the relevant Double Tax Agreement.
Within 15 days upon receipt of the response from the tax treaty partner’s competent authority,
tax authority would inform taxpayer about the outcomes of discussion and provide guidance
for implementation of requirements which are discussed and agreed upon by the competent
authorities.
3. Vietnamese competent authority under the tax treaty is the Ministry of Finance and the
Minister’s authorized person.
16
Translated by KPMG
The competent authority is the communication channel (receiving and sending documents and
announcements) between Vietnamese tax authority and tax treaty partner(s) during the process
of settlement of the request and supervision of bilateral/multilateral APA.
Article 20: Information confidentiality
1. Tax authority and taxpayer will keep information, data used during the process of settlement of
the APA request (including all procedures, process of request settlement, discussion,
negotiation, conclusion, circulation of the APA) confidential in accordance with the regulations
on tax information under Clause 3, Article 6, Tax Administration Law .
2. In cases where the APA request is terminated, withdrawn, cancelled or revoked, the
information, data supplied by taxpayer during the official APA application request, and annual
APA reports, ad-hoc reports will not be used by tax authority as evidences or documents for
the purpose of tax investigation, inspection or assessment of the taxpayer’s tax obligation.
Article 21. Compensating adjustment during APA implementation
1. During an APA implementation, taxpayer will adjust taxable income to the price or gross
margin or profit margin as stipulated in the APA for the purpose of declaration and payment of
tax in accordance with regulations.
2. In cases where corporate income tax return for the years covered in an APA have been
submitted before the signing of the APA, taxpayer will supplement the corporate income tax
return to adjust the taxable income to the price, gross margin, profit margin (if any) within 30
days upon the conclusion of the APA, unless there are inspection decision of the tax authority
and competent authority.
If the supplementary declaration increases the payable corporate income tax, taxpayer will pay
the increased tax amount and the payment for late submission in accordance with the current
regulations at the lowest rate.
If the supplementary declaration decreases the payable corporate income tax, the excessive tax
amount would be processed in accordance with regulations.
3. In case where taxpayer complies with APA’s terms and conditions but in the quarter or in the
year, there are payments which reduce the temporary tax obligation or the year finalization, the
taxpayer needs to report in written to tax authority about the related issues within 30 days since
the date when such payments are made. Taxpayer will adjust the corporate income tax return
form after tax authority provides opinions.
E.g. Company A implements APA in the year 201x with the regulated income before tax needs
to reach a profit margin of 5%, however, in 201x, the company incurs a significant payable
leading to a profit margin of only 4.5%. Assume that in reality, the payable is occurred in the
previous fiscal year (the year 201x-1) and is paid on 02 January 201x. As such, this payment
may be adjusted into the deductible expenses of the previous year (the year 201x-1).
4. In case where taxpayer’s non-APA covered related party transactions have the same or similar
characteristics to the related party transactions in the scope of the APA and such transactions
17
Translated by KPMG
are not carried out in accordance with an arm’s length principle, the taxpayer may apply the
transfer pricing methods as regulated in the APA for the purpose of adjusting the tax obligation
under Article 34 (Supplementary of tax declaration file) Law on Tax Administration.
Article 22: Taxpayer’s legal obligations in supplying information
Taxpayer needs to supply sufficiently, faithfully and exactly information, documents to tax
authority during the APA negotiation, conclusion and implementation processes. Taxpayer is
liable for the faithfulness, accuracy of the information.
