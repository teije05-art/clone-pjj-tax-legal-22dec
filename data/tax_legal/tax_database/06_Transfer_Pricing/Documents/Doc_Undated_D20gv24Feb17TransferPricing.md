Article 2 Applicable entities
1 Organizations producing and trading goods and services (hereinafter abbreviated as taxpayers)
subject to payment of corporate income tax in accordance with the declaration method and having
related party transactions as defined in article 5 of this Decree.
2 Tax authorities comprising the Department General of Taxation, provincial Tax Divisions and district
tax offices.
3 Other State agencies, organizations and individuals involved in application of the provisions on
transfer pricing including tax authorities of nations and territories which have an effective Tax Treaty
with Vietnam.
Article 3 Principles of application
1 Taxpayers with related transactions must declare them; and [must] exclude factors reducing the tax
obligations resulting from the dominant, effective associated relationship, in order to fix the tax
obligations on a related transaction the same as those on independent transactions made on the
same conditions3.
2 Tax authorities shall manage, check and inspect related transactions of taxpayers on the principle of
independent transactions and substance over form for the purpose of not recognizing related
transactions which reduce tax obligations of enterprises to the State budget, and shall adjust the
price of related transactions in order to correctly fix tax obligations as prescribed in this Decree.
3 The principle of an independent transaction is applied in accordance with the principle of the
transaction being between independent parties which do not have an associated relationship [as
stipulated in] a Tax Treaty effective for implementation in Vietnam.
Article 4 Definitions
1 Tax Treaty is an abbreviated term for Agreements on avoidance of double taxation and prevention of
tax evasion with respect to various types of taxes imposed on income and signed between Vietnam
and various nations and territories, including Treaties amending any Treaty currently effective for
implementation in Vietnam.
2 Foreign tax authority means the tax authority of a country or territory which has entered into a
Tax Treaty with Vietnam.
3 Related transaction means a transaction arising between parties with an associated relationship
during production and business and comprises a purchase, sale, exchange, lease, lease out,
borrowing, lending, delivering and/or transferring machinery, equipment or goods or supplying
services; borrowing, lending, [providing] financial services, financial security and other financial
instruments; purchase, sale, exchange, hiring, hiring out, borrowing, lending, delivering and/or
transferring tangible or intangible assets, and reaching agreement on common use of resources such
as collaborating or cooperating to exploit the use [employment] of manpower; and sharing expenses
between related parties.
4 Independent transaction means a transaction between unrelated parties.
5 Independently comparable objects ["comparables"] means independent transactions or enterprises
conducting independent transactions selected on the basis of a comparability analysis and
identification of matching comparables to fix a price level, a profit ratio, and/or a profit split ratio
3
Allens footnote: In the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) transfer pricing guidelines, the
related transaction is referred to as the controlled transaction and the comparable independent transactions as uncontrolled
transactions.

aimed at fixing the tax payable to the State budget by the taxpayer and ensuring it complies with the
Law on Tax Management and the Law on CIT.
6 Material difference means a difference in information or data which materially or significantly affects
price, profit ratio and/or the profit split ratio of the transacting parties.
7 Database of tax authority means information and data which the tax authority formulates and
manages in accordance with the Law on Tax Management relevant to fixing taxpayers' tax
obligations and which is collected, analysed, stored, updated and managed by the tax authority from
various sources including databases and information exchanged with foreign tax authorities and
competent agencies.
8 The principle of "substance over form" is a principle aimed at analysing the production and business
operation of a taxpayer in order to identify the nature of a related transaction and compare it with
similar independent transactions, ensuring that the related transaction correctly reflects the
commercial, economic and financial nature as if between non-related parties, thereby preventing the
dominant related transaction from distorting the taxpayer's tax liability to the State budget. This
principle relies on data and the actual performance of the transaction between the related parties to
compare it with independent transactions made on the same conditions, regardless of the form of the
transaction as expressed in the contract or document between the related parties. The nature of the
commercial, economic and financial relationship of the related transaction shall be identified by
comparing it with independent transactions made on the same conditions.
9 Range of independent transactions' value ["arms' length range"] means a collection of values
regarding price levels, profit ratios or profit split ratios of comparables selected by the tax authority
and the taxpayer on the basis of the databases prescribed in article 9 of this Decree. These values
[must] have a reliable level of comparability with each other. In necessary cases, the statistical
probability method may be applied to identify a standard arms' length range and in-between values
which are representative, universal [general] or common aimed at increasing the reliability of the
comparables collected.
10 Ultimate parent of the group is a term used to describe the legal entity which directly or indirectly
owns the equity of the other legal entities within the multinational group and which is itself not owned
by any other legal entity. The consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent of the group
are not consolidated into any of the financial statements of any other legal entity worldwide.

party loans secured by financial sources of the related party and including financial transactions of a
similar nature) on condition that such loans account for at least twenty five per cent (25%) of
contributed capital of the owner [equity] of the borrowing enterprise and account for more than fifty
per cent (50%) of the total value of medium and long-term loans of the borrowing enterprise;
(dd) One enterprise appoints members of the executive board [management] of another enterprise or
holds the controlling right in it [the second enterprise] on condition that the number of such members
appointed by the first enterprise accounts for over fifty per cent (50%) of the total number of
members of the executive board [management] or the first enterprise holds the controlling right in the

the financial policies or business activities of the second enterprise;
(e) Two enterprises both have above fifty per cent (50%) members on the executive board [management
of each of the two enterprises] or both have a member with power to decide the financial policies or

(k) Other cases in which an enterprise is in reality subject to executive operation and decisive control of
its production and business activities by the other enterprise.
Article 6 Comparability analysis and selection of independent comparables to compare and fix the
price of a related transaction
1 The principle of comparability analysis of independent transactions and the principle of substance
over form in order to identify the nature of a related transaction as similar to the comparables [is
regulated as follows]:
(a) [In order to identify] the nature of a transaction, a comparison shall be made between the legal
contract or transaction agreement or document of the related parties with the actual conduct [of such
transaction] by the parties. If a taxpayer has a related transaction but there are no written
agreements or if any existing written agreement is inconsistent with the independent transaction
principle [arms' length principle] or if the actual conduct of the transaction is inconsistent with the
arms' length principle between unrelated parties, then the related party transaction must be
determined in accordance with its true business nature as if between independent [non-related]
parties as follows: a related party receiving income and/or profit from a related transaction with the
taxpayer must have the ownership and business risk controlling right with respect to the assets,
goods, services, resources or rights with economic interests attached and must have the right to
create income from shareholding, share certificates and other financial instruments and the taxpayer
4
 Allens - Vietnam Laws Online Database on www.vietnamlaws.com
incurring expenses as a result of the transaction with the related party must receive actual benefits
and economic value or a contribution to the creation of turnover or added value to the production and
business activities of such taxpayer in compliance with the arms' length principle;
(b) The nature of the transaction is determined by the method of collating information, source vouchers
and data about the transaction and the risks of the related parties during the actual conduct of
production and business.
2 A comparability analysis must ensure that there is a similarity between the independent comparables
and the related transaction, without material differences affecting price level, profit ratio or profit split
ratio between the parties. If there are such material differences affecting such items, then there must
be a further analysis, determination and adjustment by eliminating the material differences from the
comparables as prescribed in clause 3 below and in compliance with each method for fixing the price
of the related transaction [transfer pricing method] as stipulated in article 7 of this Decree.
A comparability analysis to find similar [analogous] independent comparables:
(a) Selection of internal independent comparables being transactions between a taxpayer with unrelated
parties ensuring similarity and no material differences regarding price level, profit ratio or profit split
ratio between the parties. If there are no similar internal independent comparables, then comparables
shall be chosen in accordance with sub-clauses (b) and (c) of article 9.3 of this Decree. A
comparison between a related transaction and an independent transaction shall be conducted on the
basis of comparing each transaction with each similar product. If transactions are not able to be
compared based on products, then the agglomeration of transactions must ensure consistency
regarding their nature and actual business practice and application of the transfer pricing methods
stipulated in article 7 of this Decree;
(b) Financial data of comparables must be reliable for use in declaring and assessing tax and must
comply with the provisions on accounting, statistics and taxation. The time [period] when the
comparable transactions were conducted must be the same as for time of the related transaction or
their fiscal year must be the same as the fiscal year of the taxpayer, except in a special case were it
is necessary to extend the comparison period as prescribed in sub-clause (d) below. Data formats
must ensure that price levels are comparable and assessable as at the time of the transactions or
within the same tax assessment period; and data comparing profit ratios or profit split ratios must be
taken within at least three (3) consecutive tax periods. The taxpayer should round up value ratios and
corresponding ratios to the second digit after the decimal point. If relative figures are taken from
announced data which does not have absolute numbers attached and the relative figures have not
been rounded up, then these figures should be taken from data which has been announced and
which cites its sources;
(c) The minimum number of independent comparables to be selected after comparability analysis and
adjustment of material differences is as follows: one comparable if there is no difference between the
related transaction or the taxpayer conducting the related transaction [on the one hand] and the
independent comparable [on the other hand]; three comparables if there are differences between the
comparables but there is sufficient information and data for eliminating the material differences, and
five or more comparables if there is only information and data for eliminating most of the material
differences between the independent comparables;
If the similarity between the selected comparables is not reliable, then the statistical probability
method should be applied to determine a standard arms' length range and to select a value between
the collected comparables to adjust and fix a price level, profit ratio or profit split ratio of the taxpayer
in accordance with the transfer pricing methods stipulated in article 7 of this Decree;
(d) In the case of a related transaction which is unique or which has distinctive characteristics so that
independent comparables cannot be found for comparison purposes, then the scope of the
5
 Allens - Vietnam Laws Online Database on www.vietnamlaws.com
comparability analysis should be broadened to cover the industry, geographical market and/or the
period of time over which the comparison is made in order to find [appropriate] independent
comparables. Broadening the scope of the comparability analysis should be conducted as follows:
selection of independent comparables from the economic sub-industry with the highest similarity to
that of the taxpayer in the same geographical market; and by expanding the geographical market to
include countries in the region with similar industry conditions and similar economic developmental
status.
If there is a broadening of the comparability analysis to select independent comparables from other
geographical markets, then there must be both a qualitative and quantitative analysis of similarities
and of material differences prescribed in sub-clauses (e) and (d) of this article 6.2 and in article 7.2;
or figures and data from comparables of the previous year may be used and adjustments made to
material differences because of the time factor (if any).
The extended period over which figures and data of independent comparables is gathered should not
exceed one fiscal year [before or after] the fiscal year of the taxpayer if the pricing method stipulated
in article 7.2 [transactional net margin method] is used.
(dd) The bases and methods for fixing prices and independent comparables selected, and for adjusting
price levels, profit ratios or profit split ratios by a taxpayer in order to determine CIT obligations of the
taxpayer must not reduce the [amount of] tax payable to the State budget.
3 A comparability analysis applying the method of comparing, reviewing and adjusting material
differences between comparative factors in order to select independent comparables:
(a) The comparative factors include the special product characteristics of the goods, services or assets
(hereinafter abbreviated as product characteristics); the operational functions and assets and
production and business risks4; and the contractual conditions and economic conditions in which the
transaction/s took place;
(b) An analysis of the operational functions, assets, and production and business risks must determine
the main functions associated with use of the various types of assets, capital and expenses including
cooperation in exploiting and using manpower and splitting expenses between the related parties
and risks of investment of such assets and capital as well as [assumption of risks regarding] ability to
make a profit from business transactions. The functional analysis is the basis for re-determining and
redistributing the actual production and business risks of the related parties;
(c) An analysis of the special comparative factors of intangibles must include a review and analysis of
the right to recover economic benefits stipulated in the contract or agreement and the
non-contractual relationships which result in economic benefits to the parties. The analysis of
intangibles must be based on ownership of [who owns] the assets; potential benefits from the
intangibles; geographical restrictions with respect to the use and exploitation of rights to the
intangibles; asset lifecycle; rights and relationships which bring economic benefits; whether the
franchisee participates in developing the intangibles and its operational function, and the actual
ability of each related party to control business risks regarding the entire process of development,
increase, maintenance, protection and exploitation of such intangibles;
(d) An analysis of the economic conditions at the time the transaction arose must include the cost
advantage based on factors being the geographical location and the specialization function; and the
developmental status of the market and economic conditions of the business industry and sector of
the taxpayer;
4
Allens footnote: The OECD transfer pricing guidelines state that regard must be had to what the taxpayer obtained in return
for the functions it performed, the assets it used, and the risks it assumed.
6
 Allens - Vietnam Laws Online Database on www.vietnamlaws.com
(dd) A comparability analysis and elimination of material differences means an analysis and elimination of
both qualitative and quantitative differences of information or financial figures which have a major
impact on the factors used as the basis for determining the price of the related transaction in
accordance with each of the pricing methods prescribed in article 7 of this Decree. A determination of
the material differences based on quality and quantity comprises: Quantitative differences mean
differences determined by absolute numbers regarding the business cycle, and the number of years
for which the enterprise has been established and operating, or by relative numbers such as
differences regarding financial criteria in accordance with the special characteristics of the
investment industry or trade or operational function, and differences regarding working capital;
qualitative differences mean information determined and based on each pricing method.
Information determined to be critical comprises: Differences regarding product characteristics,
contractual conditions, functions, assets, risks, the business industry or trade, and economic
conditions of the taxpayer and of the independent comparables; and differences regarding policy,
investment environment, and the impact of input costs of production and business in different
geographical markets.
Quantitative and qualitative differences must be reviewed and adjusted as corresponding to the
comparative factors with a critical impact on the transfer pricing methods stipulated in article 7 of this
Decree.
(e) The results of analysis shall be the basis for selecting independent comparables appropriate for each
transfer pricing method stipulated in article 7 of this Decree.
4 The comparability analysis process comprises the following steps:
(a) A determination of the nature of the related transaction before conducting an analysis of the similarity
of the independent comparables;
(b) A comparability analysis, search and selection of similar independent comparables on the basis of
determining the comparison period, product characteristics, and contractual conditions; an analysis
of the industry, market and economic conditions at the time the transactions arose; an analysis of the
related transaction and of the taxpayer conducting it; database sources; and the method for
determining the price of the related transaction and for adjusting material differences (if any);
(c) A determination of the price level, profit ratio or profit split ratio based on the results of analysing the
independent comparables as the basis for comparing, applying and fixing the [amount of] CIT
payable by the taxpayer without reducing the tax obligations payable to the State budget. Calculation
methods must be applied uniformly throughout the business cycle and business and production
phase, consistent with the business function and models prescribed in article 7 of this Decree.
Article 7 Methods of comparing and fixing the price of the related transaction [transfer pricing methods]
Methods of comparing and fixing the price of the related transaction (abbreviated to transfer pricing
methods) shall be applied in conformity with the principle of independent transactions, the nature of the
transaction and the function of the taxpayer, on the basis of uniform calculation and application throughout
the entire business and production circle and stage; and shall be based on the financial data of the
independent comparables selected in accordance with the principles for comparability analysis stipulated in
article 6 of this Decree. The transfer pricing method/s to be selected shall be from the methods prescribed
below, based on the special characteristics of the related transaction, the availability of information and
data, and the nature of the pricing method.
The transfer pricing methods are regulated as follows:
1 The method of comparing the price of the related transaction with the prices of independent
transactions (hereinafter abbreviated as the comparable uncontrolled price method or CUP):
7
 Allens - Vietnam Laws Online Database on www.vietnamlaws.com
(a) Cases when the CUP method is applied comprise: The taxpayer conducts the related transaction for
each type of goods, tangible assets or type of services with conditions regarding trading and
common circulation on the market or at a price announced on domestic and international commodity
and services markets; a transaction being payment of royalties when exploiting tangible assets;
payment of loan interest during lending and borrowing activities; or the taxpayer conducts both
independent transactions and the related transaction for products with the same product
characteristics and on the same contractual conditions;
(b) The CUP method is applied on the principle that there are no differences regarding the product
characteristics and contractual conditions when comparing the price of independent transactions with
the price of the related transaction with a material impact on the product price. If there are material
differences affecting the product price, then these material differences must be eliminated.
Factors being product characteristics and contractual conditions with a material impact on the
product price comprise: Special characteristics, quality, and the brand or trade mark of the product,
and its size and trading volume. Contractual conditions on the supply and delivery of the products
comprise: Volume, period of delivery, period of payment and other conditions of the contract;
distribution and sale rights in the goods, services or assets affecting the economic value and market
where the transaction takes place, and other factors affecting the [unit] price of products being
economic conditions and operational function of the taxpayer.
(c) Determination method: the [unit] price of the product in the related transaction shall be adjusted to
the product prices in the independent transactions or to a price within the standard [price] range of
the independent transactions of the independent comparables in accordance with the provisions of
this Decree.
If the product price has been announced on domestic and international goods and services trading
floors, then the product price in the related transaction shall be determined as the product price
announced at the same time and on the same trading conditions. A taxpayer purchasing machinery
and equipment from a related party overseas must have data and source vouchers proving the
standard purchase price in accordance with the arm's length principle as at the time of purchase: In
the case of new machinery and equipment, the comparable price is the price in the invoice for
purchase by the related party from an independent party; and in the case of second-hand machinery
and equipment, there must be an original invoice and/or source voucher as at the time of purchase
when the asset price was re-determined in accordance with the current provisions of law guiding
management, use and depreciation of fixed assets.
(d) The result of determining the price of the related transaction shall be the taxable price for the
purposes of declaring and fixing [assessing] the amount of CIT payable, which must not reduce the
amount of tax payable by the taxpayer to the State budget.
2 The method of comparing the profit ratio of the taxpayer with profit ratios of independent
comparables [transactional net margin method or TNMM]:
(a) This method is applied when the taxpayer does not have a database and information in order to
apply the CUP method prescribed in clause 1 above; or the taxpayer is unable to compare product
transactions on the basis of comparing each transaction with another similar transaction, because
the agglomeration of transactions is aimed at compliance with the nature and actual conduct of
business and accordingly a profit margin of independent comparables must be selected, or the
taxpayer does not perform any independent function regarding the entire production and business
chain, or does not participate in overall special related transactions as prescribed in clause 3 below;
8
 Allens - Vietnam Laws Online Database on www.vietnamlaws.com
(b) Principles of application: The TNMN method is applied on the basis that there are no differences in
functions performed, assets used or risks assumed; and no differences between economic conditions
and the cost accounting methods of the taxpayer and of independent comparables materially
affecting the profit ratio. If there are such material differences, then they must be eliminated.
Factors being business functions, assets, risks and economic conditions which may materially affect
the profit margin comprise: Factors related to assets, capital and expenses; the actual controlling
rights and decision-making rights serving performance of the main function of the taxpayer;
characteristics of the business operational industry and of the product production and sales market;
cost accounting methods and product cost structure; and the economic conditions in which the
transactions took place.
Other factors which materially affect [the profit rate] may be identified by an investigation of actual
conduct as between the related parties, including the commercial or financial relations of the
multinational group; technical assistance; sharing of business know-how; use of seconded staff or
concurrent staff, and the economic conditions of the industry and business sector of the taxpayer.
Other comparable factors are product characteristics and contractual conditions.
A taxpayer conducting business with a simple function, without the decision-making right for business
strategy and with transactions which create a small amount of added value, and including enterprises
producing or distributing goods which do not assume the risk of goods in store or market risks and do
not generate revenue or expenses from exploitation of intangibles, are not subject to losses during
production and business from such risks;
(c) Calculation method: This method uses the gross profit margin or net profit margin of independent
comparables in order to fix a corresponding gross profit margin or net profit margin of the taxpayer.
The selection of the gross profit rates or net profit rates is based on revenue and expenses or on
assets depending on the nature and economic conditions of the transactions; and on the function of
the taxpayer and cost accounting methods of the parties. The basis of the profit margin is revenue
and expenses or assets as set out in the accounting figures of the taxpayer without the related
parties controlling or making any decision about the price of such related transaction.
- The method of comparing gross profit margin over turnover (the resale price method):
The buying price of the goods, services or assets (cost price) from the related party equals (=)
selling price (net turnover) of such goods, services or assets resold to an independent party less (-)
gross profit over the selling price (net turnover) of the taxpayer less (-) a number of other expenses
included in the buying price namely import duty, customs fees, insurance costs and international
freight (in any).
Gross profit over selling price (net turnover) of the taxpayer is determined from independent
comparables and equals (=) selling price (net turnover) of the taxpayer multiplied by (x) gross profit
rate over the selling price (net turnover) of the selected independent comparables.
The ratio of gross profit over selling price (net turnover) of the selected independent comparables is a
price within the standard arms' length range of such gross profit ratios over selling price (net
turnover) of the selected independent comparables, used to adjust [the taxpayer's price] for
consistency in accordance with the principles stipulated in this Decree.
The buying price from the related party (or cost price) as adjusted in accordance with the
independent comparables is the price for assessing tax, for declaring expenses and for determining
the amount of CIT payable by the taxpayer.
- The adjusted buying price (or cost price) from the related party, as adjusted by comparing with the
independent comparables, shall be the price for tax calculation purposes, and for declaration of
expenses and determination of the CIT payable by the taxpayer.
9
 Allens - Vietnam Laws Online Database on www.vietnamlaws.com
- The method of comparing ratio of gross profit over cost price (the cost price plus profit method):
The selling price or net turnover of the goods, services or assets sold to the related party is
determined as equal to (=) cost price of the goods, services or assets bought from an independent
party plus (+) profit over the cost price of the taxpayer.
Gross profit over cost price of the taxpayer is determined from independent comparables as equal to
(=) cost price of the taxpayer multiplied by (x) ratio of profit over cost price of the selected
independent comparables.
The ratios of gross profit over cost price of the selected independent comparables is a value within
the standard arms' length range of the ratios of gross profit over cost price of the selected
independent comparables used to make the appropriate adjustment in compliance with the principles
stipulated in this Decree.
The selling price to the related party (or net turnover), adjusted in accordance with the independent
comparables shall be the price for tax assessable purposes and for declaration of expenses and for
fixing the amount of CIT payable by the taxpayer.
- The method of comparing net profit ratios:
The net profit ratio pre-loan interest fees and pre-CIT on revenue, expenses or assets of the taxpayer
conducting the related transaction is adjusted in accordance with the net profit ratios pre-loan interest
fees on revenue, expenses or assets of the selected independent comparables, as the basis for
adjusting and fixing the tax obligations of the taxpayer.
Net profit does not include the difference between turnover and expenses of financial activities.
The net profit ratios selected are a value within the standard arms' length range of the net profit ratios
of the selected independent comparables in order to adjust and determine taxable income and the
amount of tax payable by the taxpayer in compliance with the principles stipulated in this Decree.
Criteria on pre-loan interest fees and pre-CIT net profit ratios shall be determined in accordance with
the provisions of the law on accounting and the law on management of tax and CIT.
3 The method of profit split between the related parties:
(a) The method of profit split between the related parties is used in the following circumstances: the
taxpayer participates in conducting a combined related transaction of a special, unique and secret
[closed] nature within the group, in activities of development of new products, using exclusive
technology for participating in a value chain of monopoly [exclusive] transactions of the group or in

function throughout the entire production and business process and is not an applicable entity as
prescribed in clauses 1 and 2 of this article;

related transaction comprising actual profit and potential profit collectable by the parties participating
in such transaction.
The adjusted profit of the taxpayer includes total basic profit plus extra profit. Basic profit is

assets or manpower of the related parties to the transaction and in compliance with the arms' length
principle.

assets or manpower of the related parties to the transaction and in compliance with the arms' length
principle.

payable without reducing the amount of the tax payable by the taxpayer to the State budget.

create added value for the group [synergies], then the taxpayer must determine the total value
created from such functions, and determine the level of profit allocation appropriate to the value of
the contribution from the related parties after subtracting (-) the corresponding amount of service fees
