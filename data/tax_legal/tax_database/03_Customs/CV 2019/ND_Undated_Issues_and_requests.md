under the 2010 Law on Credit Institutions, provided, however, that The State Bank Vietnam (or the Central Bank of Vietnam), it is
commented, will promulgate shortly the subordinate legislation. ("Legal Affairs of Enterprises entering Asia" (April 2013) at page 299)

of Discouraged Import Items immediately enforced on the same date.
This List encompasses a wide range of products including HS Chapters 73, 84, 85, 87, 90, and 91, such as certain steel made household
products (such as stove, scrub brush, hygienic porcelain, etc.), laundry machine, computer, electric appliance, camera, cassette tape
recorder, record player, golf cart, passenger car (excluding small trucks), motorcycle, bicycle, stand clock, wrist watch, etc. Products used
for production materials are excluded from this List. While this measure is not intended to build up import barriers for the listed items,
GOV attempts at restricting their imports by directing State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) to make it difficult for importers through commercial
banks (CMBs) to purchase foreign currency to import the listed items in its Official Dispatch No. 3215/NHNN-CSTT of 29 April 2010. SBV
directs CMBs to carefully examine the request for loan in foreign exchange, severely control, and restrict such loan.
Furthermore, by Decision No. 2677/QD-NHNN of 20 November 2010, SBV established an Inter-Department Working Group for
monitoring the sale and lending for payment of imported goods, while tightening lending and payment in foreign currencies services.
Working Group shall be responsible for monitoring and reporting to the Governor on a daily basis the situation of sale, lending and
remittance by credit institutions for payment of imported goods in connection with the list of non-essential imported goods items (under
Decision 1899/QD-BCT of MOIT) and the list of essential goods items manufactured locally (under Decision No. 2840/QD-BCT of MOIT of

- On 25 March 2011, the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT) promulgated Decision No. 1380/QD-BCT on adjustments based on the List
of Discouraged Import Items immediately enforced on the same date. This List encompasses a wide range of products including HS
Chapters 73, 84, 85, 87, 90, and 91, such as certain steel made household products (such as stove, scrub brush, hygienic porcelain, etc.),
laundry machine, computer, electric appliance, camera, cassette tape recorder, record player, golf cart, passenger car (excluding small
trucks), motorcycle, bicycle, stand clock, wrist watch, etc. Products used for production materials are excluded from this List. While this
measure is not intended to build up import barriers for the listed items, GOV attempts at restricting their imports by directing State Bank
of Vietnam (SBV) to make it difficult for importers through commercial banks (CMBs) to purchase foreign currency to import the listed
items in its Official Dispatch No. 3215/NHNN-CSTT of 29 April 2010. SBV directs CMBs to carefully examine the request for loan in
foreign exchange, severely control, and restrict such loan.
Furthermore, by Decision No. 2677/QD-NHNN of 20 November 2010, SBV established an inter-department working group for monitoring

- SBV on 10 March 2008 published expansion of the official exchange rate band of VND per day to plus or minus 1% (previously, 0.75%)
from the official rate of exchange. This was in response to the First Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Sinh Hung's direction given on 4
March to expand the band to plus or minus 2% as a measure to combat the record hyperinflation rate. The inflation rate in February of
15.7% against the same month in the preceding year was the record high in 12-years due to the spiraling import cost for foods and oil and
the surge of imported products from PRC. The majority of Asian currencies (including RMB) have appreciated against US$, while the
Vietnamese policy maker attempts to curb appreciation of VND, in order to promote export and to achieve the economic growth target of
8-9% per annum. With its financial policy focused on the supply of currency, GOV is redoubling its effort in curbing the VND appreciation,
which effort however has brought about the liquidity crunch. In response to the First Deputy Prime Minister 4 March direction, SBV and
GOV will take various measures to curb credit expansion and to combat inflation.

- On 12 April 2012, Circular No. 60/2012/TT-BTC "Guidance on Tax Obligation applicable to the Foreign Entities, Individuals Who Are In
Business or Have Income Derived from Vietnam", a new guideline, was promulgated. Foreign contractor tax (FCT) is levied upon profits
gained by the economic activities between individuals and organisations not domestically incorporated in Vietnam and Vietnamese
individuals and legal entities. This Guidance has added to the taxable transactions "On-The-Spot Export/Import Transactions", inclusive
of DDP, DAT, DAP. As a result, in increasing cases, deemed tax of 1% is withheld against the amount described on the contract (namely,
import declaration amount) upon Japanese corporations exporting under DDP, DAT, DAP terms (INCOTERMS). To foreign contractors, on
top of the income tax paid in the country of residence, levy of corporate income tax in Vietnam in the name of FCT amounts to "Double
Taxation".
The Circular No. 60 provides: "Foreign business organizations having or not having Vietnam-based permanent establishments; Foreign
business individuals being resident or non-resident objects in Vietnam" (Article 1). GOV's tax levy upon Japanese corporations without
permanent establishments in Vietnam is in conflict with Japan-Vietnam Tax Treaty. In increasing cases, Japanese enterprises as a

- In September 2013 Decree No. 102/2013/ND-CP of September 5, 2013, detailing a number of articles of the Labor Code regarding foreign
workers in Vietnam. This Decree among others sets forth the requisite documents for application on foreign workers permit, work permit
exemption, validity period of the application procedures permit, re-issuance, and deportation of illegal workers.
- On 16 June 2014, national congress promulgated "LAW No. 47_2014QH13 on foreigners' entry into, exit from, transit through and
residence in Vietnam" (hereafter 'exit/entry law'), tightening control on issuance of entry visas to foreigners. This LAW has been
implemented since 1 January 2015.
Under exit/entry law, the visa types are precisely defined by the purpose of entry. While this explanation focuses on business (work) and
schooling as the purposes of entry into Vietnam, in general, the proof of entry purposes is prerequisite. If it is for working, the applicant
must first acquire the newly added "work visa (Code: LD) with 2-year validity" for which work permit is necessary. If work in the local
representative office or the local branch office is the purpose of entry, “expatriate visa” [NN2 (Chief representative) or NN3 (staff)] with
12-months validity is necessary.
Article 7 of Law No. 47_2014QH13 "visa's uses and formats", new immigration law provides: "1. A visa may be used one or multiple times
and its purpose must not be changed" (unofficial english translation by embassy of Japan in Vietnam). While it is interpreted as follows in
general, in the absence of official implementation guidance in detail, there remain practical problems:
(1) After entry into Vietnam with the declared purposes of entry, no change is allowable.
(2) Change in the purposes of entry visa, or new filing of application is not possible while the applicant remains in Vietnam. In any event,
applicant must exit Vietnam once, before filing new visa application. (BTMU (Global Business Insight))

- GOV promulgated in November 2007 a series of Decrees that raise SMW rates for the year 2008 commensurate with the inflation rate for
all enterprises operating in Vietnam. These Decrees stipulate the SMW rates precisely in accordance with the nationality and the location
of each enterprise, while maintaining the double layer system, whereby higher SMW is imposed on FIEs vs. domestic enterprises. Slightly
different SMW rates are established according to each of the three-geographical-zones. GOV plans to fulfill its WTO commitments to
observe the principle of non-discrimination and the national treatment by reducing in stages the double layer system on SMW rates so
that it is totally repealed by 2012. These Decrees also compel higher SMW rates for skilled workers and workers with higher academic
degrees (at least 7% higher than unskilled workers). These Decrees enforced on 1 January 2008 have repealed all previous legislation on
SMW rates.
- On 30 October 2009, GOV promulgated Decree No. 97/2009/ND-CP, and Decree No. 98/2009/ND-CP, Prescribing the 2010 raise of the legal
minimum wage levels employers both Vietnamese and Non-Vietnamese must pay to employees.
Decree No. 97 prescribes the raise of the monthly minimum wage the domestic employers must pay in the range of 12-23% from the
current 650,000-800,000 Dong to 730,000-980,000 Dong. Decree No. 98 prescribes the raise of the monthly minimum wage the foreign
employers must pay in the range of 9-12% from the current 920,000-1,200,000 Dong to 1,000,000-1,340,000 Dong. The monthly minimum
wage varies by the area where the respective employer operates.
The GOV's adjustment of the legal minimum wage levels forms a part of the GOV's 2008-2012 reform plan for wages, social insurance and
various allowances. It is incumbent upon GOV to resolve the BI-layer legal minimum wages in Vietnam comprising of the domestic and
the foreign employers, in order to observe the WTO principle of the non-discriminatory, national treatment.

- In November VNA passed the New Land Law effective 1 July 2004. Under the New Land Law, FIEs established under Foreign Investment
Law are authorised to lease the Land Use Rights (LURs). An FIE leasing the land and making a lump sum payment for the entire lease
period is authorised to:(1) transfer or sub-lease during the lease period the LURs or the assets, which belongs to the land;(2) put up during
the lease period as mortgages or collaterals LURs and the assets to credit institutions; and (3) use as capital investment in kind LURs and
the assets during the lease period.On the other hand, land users paying the lease fees on annual installments are authorised to transfer,
sell or submit as collaterals only the assets, provided however that, most land users of foreign nationals are not able to enjoy much of the
benefit by the change of the Law. To enjoy the benefit, foreign investors are forced to purchase the land in effect. To many foreign investors,
this is not a feasible proposition since the huge amount of the upfront capital outlay is required just to lease the land. Thus, most foreign
investors choose the annual installment system. It is especially burdensome for investors considering investment in the housing assets
sector, forcing them even to scrap the plan. Moreover, this change in Law presents a difficult problem to land users of foreign nationality
desiring to mortgage the LURs of having to pay in lump sum in advance, the entire sum of the land lease fees. Suppose many of the foreign
land users do not pay in advance the lease fees for the entire lease period, or are incapable of doing so, to many foreign land users, the
LURs themselves are beyond their reach, even if they could use mortgage the land property.

(1) Approval by the competent national authority;
(2) The investor, being transferee, must satisfy the conditions as organisation or individual to conduct real estate businesses and must

- Vietnam makes commitments in the BTA that both automatic and non-automatic licensing procedures must be implemented in a
transparent and predictable manner. Vietnam agrees further that their measures will comply with international standards. This means a
commitment to be no more administratively burdensome than absolutely necessary to administer the measure, to publish sufficient
information so as to enable traders to understand how to obtain licenses and to ensure that the period of license validity is of reasonable
duration and not so short as to preclude imports. Vietnam has made tremendous efforts to improve her administrative measures in an
attempt to eliminate excessive bureaucracy and to conform to the commitments in the BTA.
For example:
-- The period of time for granting investment licenses for foreign investors is shortened.
-- Enterprises have more freedom when engaging in import-export activities. Import or export licenses are remained for certain goods as
defined by the Government from time to time.
-- A number of licenses or approvals required to do certain businesses are abolished. Further, the Government establishes a committee to
review and make suggestion to the Prime Minister on what business licenses or approvals need to be abolished from time to time.
-- Many laws and implementing regulations are promulgated in the field of customs, settlement of administrative complains of individuals
and organizations, taxation and etc. However, there are still many obstacles and difficulties to be dealt with. Implementation results of
the laws and regulations sometimes are not high because of lack of cooperation among the government agencies or of the discrepancies
among the laws and regulations themselves.
