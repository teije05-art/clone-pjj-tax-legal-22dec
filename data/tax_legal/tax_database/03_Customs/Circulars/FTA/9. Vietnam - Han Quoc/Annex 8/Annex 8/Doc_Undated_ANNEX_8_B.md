ANNEX 8-B
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
1. Scope
(a) This Annex shall apply to measures adopted or maintained by a Party affecting
trade in public telecommunications transport networks and services.
(b) Except to ensure that service suppliers operating broadcast stations and cable
systems have continued access to and use of public telecommunications
transport networks or services, this Annex shall not apply to any measure
relating to broadcast or cable distribution of radio or television programming.
(c) Nothing in this Annex shall be construed to:
(i) require a Party, or require a Party to compel any service supplier, to
establish, construct, acquire, lease, operate, or provide
telecommunications transport networks or services not offered to the
public generally; or
(ii) require a Party to compel any service supplier exclusively engaged in
the broadcast or cable distribution of radio or television programming
to make available its broadcast or cable facilities as a public
telecommunications transport network.
2. Access and Use1
(a) Each Party shall ensure that service suppliers of the other Party have access to
and use of any public telecommunications transport network and service,
including leased circuits, offered in its territory or across its borders, on
reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions, including those set
out in subparagraphs (b) through (f).
(b) Each Party shall ensure that service suppliers of the other Party are permitted
to:
(i) purchase or lease, and attach terminal or other equipment that
interfaces with a public telecommunications transport network and
which is necessary to supply a supplier’s services;
(ii) connect owned or leased circuits with public telecommunications
transport networks and services or with circuits leased or owned by
another service supplier;2 and
1 Viet Nam may place reasonable conditions on access to and use of public telecommunications transport
networks and services necessary to strengthen its domestic telecommunications infrastructure and service
capacity and to increase its participation in international trade in telecommunications services.
8-1
(iii) use operating protocols of their choice in the supply of any service,
other than as necessary to ensure the availability of
telecommunications transport networks and services to the public
generally.
(c) Each Party shall ensure that service suppliers of the other Party may use public
telecommunications transport networks and services for the movement of
information in its territory or across its borders, including for intra-corporate
communications, and for access to information contained in databases or
otherwise stored in machine-readable form in the territory of either Party.
(d) Notwithstanding subparagraph (c), a Party may take such measures as are
necessary to ensure the security and confidentiality of messages, provided that
such measures are not applied in a manner that would constitute a means of
arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or disguised restriction on trade in
services.
(e) Each Party shall ensure that no condition is imposed on access to and use of
public telecommunications transport networks and services, other than as
necessary to:
(i) safeguard the public service responsibilities of suppliers of public
telecommunications transport networks and services, in particular their
ability to make their networks or services available to the public
generally;
(ii) protect the technical integrity of public telecommunications transport
networks or services; or
(iii) ensure that service suppliers of the other Party do not supply services
unless permitted pursuant to commitments in that Party’s Schedule of
Specific Commitments.
(f) Provided that the conditions satisfy the criteria set out in subparagraph (e),
such conditions for access to and use of public telecommunications transport
networks and services may include:
(i) restrictions on resale or shared use of such services;
(ii) a requirement to use specified technical interfaces, including interface
protocols, for interconnection with such networks or services;
(iii) requirements, where necessary, for the interoperability of such
networks and services;
2 For Viet Nam, networks authorized to establish for the purposes of carrying out, on a non-commercial basis,
voice and data telecommunications between members of a closed user group can only directly interconnect with
each other where approved in writing by the telecommunications authority.
8-2
(iv) type approval of terminal or other equipment which interfaces with the
network and technical requirements relating to the attachment of such
equipment to such networks;
(v) restrictions on interconnection of private leased or owned circuits with
such networks or services or with circuits leased or owned by another

3. Competitive Safeguards
(a) Each Party shall prevent suppliers of public telecommunications transport
networks or services who, alone or together, are major suppliers in its territory,
from engaging in or continuing anti-competitive practices.
(b) The anti-competitive practices referred to in this paragraph shall include:
(i) engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidization;
(ii) using information obtained from competitors with anti-competitive
results; and
(iii) not making available to other suppliers of telecommunications
transport networks or services, in a timely fashion, technical
information about essential facilities or commercially relevant
information, which is necessary for such suppliers to provide public
telecommunications transport networks or services.
4. Licensing Process
(a) When a Party requires a supplier of public telecommunications transport
networks or services to have a license, the Party shall make publicly available:
(i) all the licensing criteria and procedures it applies;
(ii) the period it normally requires to reach a decision concerning an
application for a license; and
(iii) the terms and conditions of all licenses in effect.
(b) Each Party shall ensure that, upon request, an applicant receives the reasons
for the denial of a license.
8-3
5. Interconnection3
(a) Each Party shall ensure that major suppliers in its territory provide
interconnection to suppliers of public telecommunications transport networks
or services of the other Party at any technically feasible point in the major
supplier’s network. Such interconnection shall be:
(i) provided in a timely fashion, on terms and conditions (including
technical standards and specifications), and at cost-oriented rates, that
are reasonable (having regard to economic feasibility), non-
discriminatory and transparent;
(ii) sufficiently unbundled, such that the supplier of public
telecommunications transport networks or services seeking
interconnection need not pay for network components or facilities that
it does not require for the service to be provided;
(iii) of a quality no less favorable than that provided for the major
supplier’s own like services, or for like services of non-affiliated
service suppliers, or for its subsidiaries or other affiliates; and
(iv) provided upon request, at points in addition to the network termination
points offered to the majority of users, subject to charges that reflect
the cost of construction of necessary additional facilities.
(b) Each Party shall ensure that the terms, conditions and rates (including
technical standards and specifications) for interconnection between major
suppliers in its territory and suppliers of public telecommunications transport
networks or services of the other Party are able to be established (at least):
(i) through commercial negotiation; or
(ii) by reference to a set of standard terms, conditions and rates that the
major supplier offers generally to other suppliers of public
telecommunications transport networks or services, and that are
approved or set out by a telecommunications regulatory body.
(c) Each Party shall ensure that the procedures for interconnection with major
suppliers in its territory are published or otherwise made publicly available.
3 With respect to sub-subparagraphs (i) through (iii) of subparagraph (a), Korea may permit major suppliers to
offer rates, terms, and conditions to non-facilities-based suppliers of public telecommunications transport
services that are less favorable than those offered to facilities-based suppliers of public telecommunications
transport networks or services. For greater certainty, Korea shall ensure that a non-facilities-based supplier of
public telecommunications transport services may have recourse, as provided in paragraph 13, to the
telecommunications regulatory body regarding disputes over such rates, terms, and conditions. Sub-
subparagraph (iv) of subparagraph (a) does not apply to Korea with respect to non-facilities-based suppliers of
public telecommunications transport services.
8-4
(d) Each Party shall ensure that suppliers of public telecommunications transport
networks or services in its territory take reasonable steps to protect the
confidentiality of commercially sensitive information of, or relating to,
suppliers and end-users of public telecommunications transport networks or
services obtained as a result of interconnection arrangements and only use
such information for the purposes of providing these services.
6. Colocation4
(a) Each Party shall ensure that major suppliers in its territory:
(i) provide to suppliers of public telecommunications transport networks
or services of the other Party that are facilities-based suppliers in the
territory of that Party, physical colocation of equipment necessary for
interconnection; and
(ii) in situations where physical colocation referred to in sub-subparagraph
(i) is not practical for technical reasons or because of space limitations,
cooperate with suppliers of public telecommunications transport
networks or services of the other Party that are facilities-based
suppliers in the territory of that Party, to find and implement a practical
and commercially viable alternative solution.5
(b) Each Party shall ensure that major suppliers in its territory provide the
physical colocation or practical and commercially viable alternative solution
referred to in subparagraph (a) in a timely fashion and on terms and conditions
(including technical standards and specifications), and at rates, that are
reasonable (having regard to economic feasibility), non-discriminatory and
transparent.
(c) Each Party may determine, in accordance with its domestic laws and
regulations, the locations at which it requires major suppliers in its territory to
4 For Viet Nam, colocation may not be applied to essential telecommunications infrastructures such as
submarine cable landing station, and international gateway. Essential telecommunications infrastructures would
be stipulated by competent regulatory body. This obligation applies three years after the date it is duly reflected
in Viet Nam’s domestic laws and regulations. This paragraph does not apply to Korea with respect to non-
facilities-based suppliers of public telecommunications transport services.
5 Such solutions may include:
(a) permitting facilities-based suppliers to locate equipment in a nearby building and to connect such
equipment to the major supplier’s network;
(b) conditioning additional equipment space or virtual colocation;
(c) optimizing the use of existing space; and
(d) finding adjacent space.
8-5
provide the physical colocation or the practical and commercially viable
alternative solutions referred to in subparagraph (a).
7. Leased Circuits Services6
Each Party shall, unless it is not technically feasible, ensure that major suppliers in its
territory make leased circuits services (that are public telecommunications transport services)
available to suppliers of public telecommunications transport networks or services of the
other Party in a timely fashion and on terms and conditions (including technical standards and
specifications), and at rates, that are reasonable (having regard to economic feasibility), non-
discriminatory and transparent.
8. Resale7
Each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory does not impose unreasonable or
discriminatory conditions or limitations on the resale of its public telecommunications
transport networks or services.
9. Number Portability8
Each Party shall ensure that suppliers of public telecommunications transport networks or
services in its territory provide number portability for mobile phone services to the extent
technically and economically feasible, and on reasonable terms and conditions.
10. Telecommunications Regulatory Body
(a) Each Party shall establish or maintain, as part of its domestic legal framework,
a telecommunications regulatory body.
(b) Each Party shall ensure that every telecommunications regulatory body that it
establishes or maintains is separate from, and not accountable to, any supplier
of public telecommunications transport networks or services.
(c) Each Party shall ensure that the functions and responsibilities of the
telecommunications regulatory body or bodies, which shall include
enforcement of the commitments set out in paragraph 5, and all of its decision
making powers shall be set out in its domestic laws and regulations.
6 For Viet Nam, this obligation applies three years after the date it is duly reflected in Viet Nam's domestic laws
and regulations. Korea may permit major suppliers to offer rates, terms, and conditions to non-facilities-based
suppliers of public telecommunications transport services that are less favorable than those offered to facilities-
based suppliers of public telecommunications transport networks or services. For greater certainty, Korea shall
ensure that a non-facilities-based supplier of public telecommunications transport services may have recourse,
as provided in paragraph 13, to the telecommunications regulatory body regarding disputes over such rates,
terms, and conditions.
7 For Viet Nam, resale can be provided when a service supplier has a license to provide such service.
8 This obligation applies three years after the date it is duly reflected in Viet Nam's domestic laws and
regulations.
8-6
(d) Each Party shall ensure that the decisions of, and the procedures used by, its
telecommunications regulatory body or bodies are impartial with respect to all
interested persons.
(e) Each Party shall ensure that any supplier of public telecommunications
transport networks or services of the other Party that is aggrieved, or whose
interests are adversely affected by a determination or decision of a
telecommunications regulatory body of that Party, may obtain review of the
determination or decision by an administrative, arbitral or judicial tribunal or
authority or according to administrative, arbitral or judicial procedures. Where
such procedures are not independent of the telecommunications regulatory
body, the Party shall ensure that the procedures in fact provide for an objective
and impartial review.
11. Universal Service
Each Party shall administer any universal service obligation that it maintains in a transparent,
non-discriminatory, and competitively neutral manner and shall ensure that its universal
service obligation is not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service
that it has defined.
12. Allocation and Use of Scarce Resources
(a) Each Party shall administer its procedures for the allocation and use of scarce
telecommunications resources, including frequencies, numbers, and rights-of-
way, in an objective, timely, transparent, and non-discriminatory manner.
(b) Each Party shall make publicly available the current state of allocated
frequency bands but retains the right not to provide detailed identification of
frequencies allocated or assigned for specific government uses.
(c) A Party’s measures allocating and assigning spectrum and managing
frequency are not measures that are per se inconsistent with Article 8.4.
Accordingly, each Party retains the right to establish and apply spectrum and
frequency management policies that may have the effect of limiting the
number of suppliers of public telecommunications transport services, provided
it does so in a manner consistent with other provisions of this Agreement. This
includes the ability to allocate frequency bands, taking into account current
and future needs and spectrum availability.
13. Resolution of Telecommunications Disputes
(a) Each Party shall ensure that suppliers of public telecommunications transport
networks or services of the other Party may have timely recourse to its
telecommunications regulatory body or dispute settlement body to settle
disputes in accordance with its domestic laws and regulations.
8-7
(b) Each Party shall ensure that any supplier of public telecommunications
transport networks or services aggrieved by a final determination or decision
of its relevant telecommunications regulatory body may obtain an independent
judicial review of such determination or decision in accordance with its
domestic laws and regulations. Neither Party shall permit such review to
constitute grounds for non-compliance with such determination or decision of
the body unless the relevant judicial authority withholds, suspends or repeals
such determination or decision.
14. Transparency
Further to Article 14.1 (Publication), each Party shall ensure that relevant information on
conditions affecting access to and use of public telecommunications transport networks and
services is publicly available, including:
(a) tariffs and other terms and conditions of service;
(b) specifications of technical interfaces with such networks and services;
(c) information on bodies responsible for preparing, amending, and adopting
standards related measures;
(d) conditions applying to attachment of terminal or other equipment to public
telecommunications transport networks; and
(e) notification, permit, registration, or licensing requirements, if any.
15. Relation to International Organizations and Agreements
The Parties recognize the importance of international standards for global compatibility and
inter-operability of telecommunication networks and services and undertake to promote such
standards through the work of relevant international bodies, including the International
Telecommunication Union and the International Organization for Standardization.
