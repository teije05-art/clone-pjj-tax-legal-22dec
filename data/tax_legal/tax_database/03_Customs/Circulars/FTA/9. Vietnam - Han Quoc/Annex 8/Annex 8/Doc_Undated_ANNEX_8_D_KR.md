Explanation on Financial Services
1. Financial sectors are basically re-classified according to the category of Annex 8-A. Therefore the order of sub-sectors is different from that of the commitment in
GATS/SC/48/Suppl.3/Rev.1.
2. Specific statements in the sub-sectors apply only to existing domestic financial services.
7. FINANCIAL SERVICES
All financial services are subject to the following provisions.
(1) For prudential reasons within the context of paragraph 2(a) of Annex 8-A, Korea shall not be prevented from taking measures including requirements related to
parent companies, the minimum capital requirement, minimum operating funds requirement, business worker's license and approval for business activities.
(2) A financial institution must be established for only one business defined in related law and thus cannot engage in other business activities regulated by other
relevant laws.
(3) Cross-border supply of financial services and supply through consumer movement shall not be settled in Korean Won. After the establishment of a commercial
presence, financial institutions may handle only transactions, denominated and settled in Korean Won, with residents. Approval is required for transactions
denominated or settled in foreign currency or transactions with non-residents.
(4) Assets owned by branches must be kept within the territory of Korea. Capital of the head office is not recognized as the basis for determining the extent of
funding and lending activities of domestic branches.
(5) Demand deposit interest rates are regulated.
(6) The management and operation of assets of a financial institution are restricted.
(7) A financial institution may not own non-business real estate.

ATTACHMENT 1 : REFERENCE PAPER
Scope
The following are definitions and principles on the regulatory framework for the basic
telecommunications services.
Definitions
Users mean service consumers and service suppliers.
Essential facilities mean facilities of a public telecommunications transport network or
service that
(a) are exclusively or predominantly provided by a single or limited number of
suppliers; and
(b) cannot feasibly be economically or technically substituted in order to provide
a service.
A major supplier is a supplier which has the ability to materially affect the terms of
participation (having regard to price and supply) in the relevant market for basic
telecommunications services as a result of:
(a) control over essential facilities; or
(b) use of its position in the market.
1. Competitive safeguards
1.1 Prevention of anti-competitive practices in telecommunications
Appropriate measures shall be maintained for the purpose of preventing suppliers who,
alone or together, are a major supplier from engaging in or continuing anti-competitive
practices.
1.2 Safeguards
The anti-competitive practices referred to above shall include in particular:
(a) engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidization;
(b) using information obtained from competitors with anti-competitive results;
and
(c) not making available to other services suppliers on a timely basis technical
information about essential facilities and commercially relevant information
which are necessary for them to provide services.
52
2. Interconnection
2.1 This section applies to linking with suppliers providing public telecommunications
transport networks or services in order to allow the users of one supplier to communicate
with users of another supplier and to access services provided by another supplier, where
specific commitments are undertaken.
2.2 Interconnection to be ensured
Interconnection with a major supplier will be ensured at any technically feasible point
in the network. Such interconnection is provided.
(a) under non-discriminatory terms, conditions (including technical standards and
specifications) and rates and of a quality no less favourable than that provided
for its own like services or for like services of non-affiliated service
suppliers or for its subsidiaries or other affiliates;
(b) in a timely fashion, on terms, conditions (including technical standards and
specifications) and cost-oriented rates that are transparent, reasonable, having
regard to economic feasibility, and sufficiently unbundled so that the
supplier need not pay for network components or facilities that it does not
require for the service to be provided; and
(c) upon request, at points in addition to the network termination points offered to
the majority of users, subject to charges that reflect the cost of construction of
necessary additional facilities.
2.3 Public availability of the procedures for interconnection negotiations
The procedures applicable for interconnection to a major supplier will be made
publicly available.
2.4 Transparency of interconnection arrangements
It is ensured that a major supplier will make publicly available either its
interconnection agreements or a reference interconnection offer.
2.5 Interconnection: dispute settlement
A service supplier requesting interconnection with a major supplier will have recourse,
either:
(a) at any time or
(b) after a reasonable period of time which has been made publicly known
to an independent domestic body, which may be a regulatory body as referred
to in paragraph 5 below, to resolve disputes regarding appropriate terms,
53
conditions and rates for interconnection within a reasonable period of time, to
the extent that these have not been established previously.
3. Universal service
Either Party has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it wishes to
maintain. Such obligations will not be regarded as anti-competitive per se, provided they are
administered in a transparent, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner and are
not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the Party.
4. Public availability of licensing criteria
Where a licence is required, the following will be made publicly available:
(a) all the licensing criteria and the period of time normally required to reach a
decision concerning an application for a licence; and
(b) the terms and conditions of individual licences.
The reasons for the denial of a licence will be made known to the applicant upon
request.
5. Independent regulators
The regulatory body is separate from, and not accountable to, any supplier of basic
telecommunications services. The decisions of and the procedures used by regulators shall be
impartial with respect to all market participants.
6. Allocation and use of scarce resources
Any procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources, including frequencies,
numbers and rights of way, will be carried out in an objective, timely, transparent and non-
discriminatory manner. The current state of allocated frequency bands will be made publicly
available, but detailed identification of frequencies allocated for specific government uses is
not required.
