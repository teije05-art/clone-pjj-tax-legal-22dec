ANNEX 8-C
MOVEMENT OF NATURAL PERSONS
1. Scope
(a) This Annex shall apply to measures affecting the movement of natural persons
of a Party falling under the categories specified in Annex 8-D by the other
Party into the territory of the other Party.
(b) This Annex shall not apply to measures affecting natural persons of a Party
seeking access to the employment market of the other Party, nor shall it apply
to measures regarding citizenship, residence or employment on a permanent
basis.
(c) Nothing in this Annex shall prevent a Party from applying measures to
regulate the entry of natural persons of the other Party into, or their temporary
stay in, its territory, including those measures necessary to protect the integrity
of, and to ensure the orderly movement of natural persons across, its borders,
provided that such measures are not applied in a manner to nullify or impair
the benefits accruing to the other Party under this Annex.
(d) The sole fact that a Party requires natural persons of the other Party to obtain
an immigration formality shall not be regarded as nullifying or impairing the
benefits accruing to the other Party under this Annex, or as unduly impairing
or delaying trade in goods or services or the conduct of investment activities
under this Agreement.
2. Objective
The objective of this Annex is to provide for rights and obligations additional to those set out
in this Chapter in relation to the movement of natural persons between the Parties for
business purposes.
3. Application Procedures
(a) As expeditiously as possible after receipt of a complete application for an
immigration formality, each Party shall make a decision on the application and
inform the applicant of the decision including, if approved, the period of stay
and other conditions.
(b) Upon request of an applicant, a Party in receipt of a complete application for
an immigration formality shall promptly provide, without undue delay,
information concerning the status of the application. Each Party shall notify
the applicant for temporary entry, either directly or indirectly through his/her
employer, of the outcome of the final determination, including the period of
stay and other conditions. In the case of an incomplete application, the Party
8-1
shall notify the applicant of all the additional information that is required to
complete the application and provide the opportunity to remedy deficiencies.
(c) If an application is denied, each Party shall, to the maximum extent possible,
inform the applicant of the reasons for such action in writing and without
delay. The applicant will have the possibility of resubmitting, at its discretion,
a new application.
(d) Any fees imposed in respect of the processing of an immigration formality
shall be reasonable and in accordance with domestic laws and regulations of
each Party, so as to avoid unduly impairing or delaying trade in goods or
services or conduct of investment activities under this Agreement.
4. Conditions and Limitations for the Movement of Natural Persons
(a) Each Party shall set out, in Annex 8-D, its specific commitments with regard
to the movement of natural persons of the other Party into its territory, which
shall specify the conditions and limitations for entry and temporary stay,
including length of stay, for each category of natural persons.
(b) Each Party shall ensure natural persons covered by a specific commitment
referred to in subparagraph (a) above to be granted entry and temporary stay in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the specific commitments set out
in Annex 8-D, provided that the natural persons comply with immigration
laws and regulations applicable to entry and temporary stay.
(c) The sole fact that a Party grants temporary entry to a natural person of the
other Party pursuant to this Annex shall not be construed to exempt that
natural person from meeting any applicable licensing or other requirements, to
practise a profession or otherwise engage in business activities.
5. Transparency
(a) Each Party shall publish or otherwise make available to the other Party on the
date of entry into force of this Agreement, information on application
requirements and procedures relating to its specific commitments with respect
to movement of natural persons of the other Party for the grant of entry into,
temporary stay in or renewal thereof, the former Party.
(b) Each Party shall maintain or establish contact points or other mechanisms to
respond to inquiries from the other Party regarding regulations affecting the
movement of natural persons.
(c) In accordance with its domestic laws and regulations, each Party shall allow a
reasonable period of time between publication of regulations affecting the
movement of natural persons and their effective date.
8-2
(d) Within three months from the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the
Parties shall exchange information on current procedures relating to the
processing of applications for temporary entry.
(e) Each Party shall endeavor to promptly inform the other Party of the
introduction of any new requirement and procedure, or change in any existing
requirement and procedure referred to in subparagraph (a) that affects the
effective application by natural persons of the other Party for the grant of entry
into, initial temporary stay in or renewal thereof, the former Party.
6. Dispute Settlement
(a) A Party shall not have recourse to Chapter 15 (Dispute Settlement) regarding a
refusal to grant temporary entry under this Annex unless:
(i) the matter involves a pattern of practice; and
(ii) the natural persons affected have exhausted all available domestic
administrative remedies regarding the particular matter.
(b) The remedies referred to in sub-subparagraph (ii) of subparagraph (a) shall be
deemed to be exhausted if a final determination in the matter has not been
issued by the other Party within a reasonable period of time after the date of
the institution of proceedings for the remedy, including any proceeding for
review or appeal, and the failure to issue such a determination is not
attributable to delays caused by the natural persons concerned.
7. Committee on Movement of Natural Persons
(a) The Parties hereby establish a Committee on Movement of Natural Persons
(hereinafter referred to as the “Committee”) comprising representatives of
each Party, including immigration officials. Unless otherwise agreed by the
Parties, the Committee shall convene once a year.

natural persons, the Parties shall consider undertaking mutually agreed cooperation activities,
subject to available resources, including by:

processing systems for visas;
