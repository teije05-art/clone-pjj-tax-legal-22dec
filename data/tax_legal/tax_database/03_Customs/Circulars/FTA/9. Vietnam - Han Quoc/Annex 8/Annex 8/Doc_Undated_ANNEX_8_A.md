ANNEX 8-A
FINANCIAL SERVICES
1. Scope
This Annex applies to measures affecting the supply of financial services.
2. Prudential Carve-out1, Exchange Rate and Financial Stability
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, a Party shall not be
prevented from taking measures for prudential reasons2, including for the protection of
investors, depositors, policy-holders or persons to whom a fiduciary duty is owed by a
financial service supplier, to ensure the integrity and stability of the financial system, or to
ensure stability of the exchange rate3 including to prevent speculative capital flows, subject to
the following:
(i) where such measures do not conform with the provisions of this
Agreement, they shall not be used as a means of avoiding that Party’s
commitments or obligations under this Agreement;
(ii) for measures to ensure the stability of the exchange rate including to
prevent speculative capital flows, such measures shall be no more than
necessary, and shall be phased out within one year or when conditions
no longer justify their institution or maintenance; and
(iii) for measures to ensure the stability of the exchange rate including to
prevent speculative capital flows, such measures shall be applied on a
Most-Favored-Nation basis.
(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require a Party to disclose
information relating to the affairs and accounts of individual service
consumers or any confidential or proprietary information in the possession of
public entities.
(c) Without prejudice to other means of prudential regulation of cross-border
trade in financial services, a Party may require the registration of cross-border
financial service suppliers of the other Party and of financial instruments.
1 Any measure which is applied to financial service suppliers established in a Party’s territory that are not
regulated and supervised by the financial supervisory authority of that Party would be deemed to be a
prudential measure for the purposes of this Agreement. For greater certainty, any such measure shall be taken in
line with this paragraph.
2 It is understood that the term “prudential reasons” may include the maintenance of the safety, soundness,
integrity, or financial responsibility of individual financial service suppliers.
3 The measures to ensure the stability of the exchange rate including to prevent speculative capital flows shall
not be adopted or maintained for the purposes of protecting a particular sector.

Annex applies are administered in a reasonable, objective, and impartial

opportunity to comment4 on such proposed regulation; and

completed application of a financial institution, or a cross-border financial
service supplier of the other Party relating to the supply of a financial service
within 180 days5, and shall promptly notify the applicant of the decision. An
application shall not be considered complete until all relevant hearings are

new law or regulation or modification of an existing law or regulation. A Party may

may be refused only for prudential reasons6.
