ATTACHMENT 1 : REFERENCE PAPER
Scope

The following are definitions and principles on the regulatory framework for the basic
telecommunications services,

Definitions
Users mean service consumers and service suppliers.

Essential facilities mean facilities of a public telecommunications transport network or
service that

(a) are exclusively or predominantly provided by a single or limited number of
suppliers; and

(b) cannot feasibly be economically or technically substituted in order to provide
a service.

A major supplier is a supplier which has the ability to materially affect the terms of
participation (having regard to price and supply) in the relevant market for basic
telecommunications services as a result of:

(a) control over essential facilities; or

(b) use of its position in the market.

Competitive safeguards

1.1... Prevention of anti-competitive practices in telecommunications

Appropriate measures shall be maintained for the purpose of preventing suppliers
who, alone or together, are a major supplier from engaging in or continuing anti-competitive
practices.

12  Safguar

The anti-competitive practices referred to above shall include in particular:

(a) engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidization;

(@®) using information obtained from competitors with anti-competitive results;
and

(c) — not making available to other services suppliers on a timely basis technical
information about essential facilities and commercially relevant information
which are necessary for them to provide services.



--- PAGE BREAK ---

2. Interconnection

2.1 This section applies to linking with suppliers providing public telecommunications
transport networks or services in order to allow the users of one supplier to communicate
with users of another supplier and to access services provided by another supplier, where
specific commitments are undertaken.

2.2 Interconnection to be ensured

Interconnection with a major supplier will be ensured at any technically feasible point
in the network. Such interconnection is provided.

(a) _ under non-discriminatory terms, conditions (including technical standards and
specifications) and rates and of a quality no less favourable than that provided
for its own like services or for like services of non-affiliated service suppliers
or for its subsidiaries or other affiliates;

in a timely fashion, on terms, conditions (including technical standards and
specifications) and cost-oriented rates that are transparent, reasonable, having
regard to economic feasibility, and sufficiently unbundled so that the supplier
need not pay for network components or facilities that it does not require for
the service to be provided; and

upon request, at points in addition to the network termination points offered to
the majority of users, subject to charges that reflect the cost of construction of
necessary additional facilities.

2.3 Public availability of the procedures for interconnection negotiations

The procedures applicable for interconnection to a major supplier will be made
publicly available.

2.4 Transparency of interconnection arrangements

It is ensured that a major supplier will make publicly available either its
interconnection agreements or a reference interconnection offer.

2.5 Interconnection: dispute settlement

A service supplier requesting interconnection with a major supplier will have
recourse, either:

(a) at any time or
after a reasonable period of time which has been made publicly known

to an independent domestic body, which may be a regulatory body as referred
to in paragraph 5 below, to resolve disputes regarding appropriate terms,



--- PAGE BREAK ---

conditions and rates for interconnection within a reasonable period of time, to
the extent that these have not been established previously.

Universal service

Either Party has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it wishes to
maintain. Such obligations will not be regarded as anti-competitive per se, provided they are
administered in a transparent, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner and are
not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the Party.

Public availability of licensing criteria

Where a licence is required, the following will be made publicly available:

(a) _ all the licensing criteria and the period of time normally required to reach a
decision concerning an application for a licence; and

(b) the terms and conditions of individual licences.

The reasons for the denial of a licence will be made known to the applicant upon
request.

5. Independent regulators

The regulatory body is separate from, and not accountable to, any supplier of basic
telecommunications services. The decisions of and the procedures used by regulators shall be
impartial with respect to all market participants,

6. Allocation and use of scarce resources

Any procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources, including frequencies,
numbers and rights of way, will be carried out in an objective, timely, transparent and non-
discriminatory manner. The current state of allocated frequency bands will be made publicly
available, but detailed identification of frequencies allocated for specific government uses is
not required.
