undertaking if practicable.

2. In an anti-dumping investigation, where a Party’s authorities have made a preliminary
affirmative determination of dumping and injury caused by such dumping, the Party shall
afford due consideration, and adequate opportunity for consultations, to exporters of the other

ANNEX 9-B

EXPROPRIATION

The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:

{a)

an action or a series of actions by a Party cannot constitute an expropriation
unless it interferes with a tangible or intangible property right in an investment;

paragraph 1 of Article 9.7 addresses two situations. The first is direct
expropriation, where a covered investment is nationalized or otherwise directly
expropriated through formal transfer of title or outright seizure;

the second situation addressed by paragraph 1 of Article 9.7 is indirect
expropriation, where an action or a series of actions by a Party has an effect
equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright
seizure:

@

the determination of whether an action or a series of actions by a Party,
in a specific fact situation, constitutes an indirect expropriation, requires
a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers all relevant factors
relating to the investment, including:

{A) the economic impact of the government action, although the fact
that an action or a series of actions by a Party has an adverse
effect on the economic value of an investment, standing alone,
does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred;

{B) the extent to which the government action interferes with
distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations; and

(C) — the character of the government action, including its objectives
and context.”°;

series of actions is extremely severe or disproportionate in light of its
purpose or effect, non-discriminatory regulatory actions by a Party
that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare
objectives, such as public health, safety, the environment, do not
constitute indirect expropriations.”” 28

?6 For greater certainty, for Korea, relevant considerations may include whether the government action imposes a
special sacrifice on the particular investor or investment that exceeds what the investor or investment should be
expected to endure for the public interest.

?? For greater certainty, this subparagraph includes the right of the Party to exercise its regulatory actions in
accordance with its Constitution.

Subparagraph 4(h) of Article 9.8(Transfers) shall apply to taxation measures.

constitutes an expropriation requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers all

(a) the imposition of taxes does not generally constitute an expropriation. The
mere introduction of a new taxation measure or the imposition of a taxation
measure in more than one jurisdiction in respect of an investment generally
does not in and of itself constitute an expropriation;

a taxation measure that is consistent with internationally recognized tax
policies, principles, and practices does not constitute an expropriation. In
particular, a taxation measure aimed at preventing the avoidance or evasion of
taxation measures generally does not constitute an expropriation;

a taxation measure that is applied on a non-discriminatory basis, as opposed to
a taxation measure that is targeted at investors of a particular nationality or at
specific taxpayers, is less likely to constitute an expropriation; and

a taxation measure does not constitute an expropriation if it was already in
force when the investment was made and information about the measure was
publicly available.

Article XIV (đ) and (e) of GATS.

competent authorities, at the time that it gives its Notice of Intent under Article 9.17(Notice
of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration), for decision on the issue of whether taxation
measure is not an expropriation. The request should include the Notice of Intent. If the
competent authorities do not agree to consider the issue or, having agreed to consider it, fail
to agree that the measure is not an expropriation within a period of six months of such
referral, the investor may submit its claim to arbitration under paragraph 1 of Article
9.19(Submission of a Claim to Arbitration).

(b) For the purposes of this paragraph, competent authorities means:

(i) for Viet Nam, the Director General of the General Department of
Taxation, Ministry of Finance; and
