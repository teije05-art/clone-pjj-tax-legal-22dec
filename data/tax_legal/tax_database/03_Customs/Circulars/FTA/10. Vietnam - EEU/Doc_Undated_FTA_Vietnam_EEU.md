transfer of any right or claim of the investor in respect of such investment to
the former Party or its designated agency. The subrogated or transferred right
or claim shall not be greater than the original right or claim of the investor.
For greater certainty, such right or claim shall be exercised in accordance with
the laws and regulations of the latter Party, but without prejudice to Articles
8.21, 8.22, 8.23, 8.24 and 8.25 of this Agreement.
