CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS
Article (…)
Objectives, coverage and definitions
1. The Parties, reaffirming their respective commitments under the WTO Agreement and
their commitment to create a better climate for the development of trade and
investment between the Parties, hereby lay down the necessary arrangements for the
progressive liberalisation of trade in services and investment and for cooperation on e-
commerce
2. Consistent with the provisions of this Title, each Party retains the right to adopt,
maintain and enforce measures necessary to pursue legitimate policy objectives such
as the protection of society, the environment and public health, the integrity and
stability of the financial system, the promotion of security and safety, and the
promotion and protection of cultural diversity.
3. This Title shall not apply to measures affecting natural persons seeking access to the
employment market of a Party, nor shall it apply to measures regarding citizenship,
residence or employment on a permanent basis.
Nothing in this Title shall prevent a Party from applying measures to regulate the entry
of natural persons into, or their temporary stay in, its territory, including those
measures necessary to protect the integrity of, and to ensure the orderly movement of
natural persons across its borders, provided that such measures are not applied in such
a manner as to nullify or impair the benefits1 accruing to any Party under the terms of
a specific commitment in this Chapter and its Annexes.
4. For purposes of this Title:
(a) a ‘natural person of the EU’ means a national of one of the Member States of
the European Union in accordance with its legislation and a ‘natural person of
Viet Nam’ means a national of Viet Nam in accordance with its legislation;
(b) ‘juridical person’ means any legal entity duly constituted or otherwise
organised under applicable law, whether for profit or otherwise, and whether
privately-owned or governmentally-owned, including any corporation, trust,
partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship or association;
(c) a ‘juridical person of the EU’ or a ‘juridical person of Viet Nam’ means a
juridical person set up in accordance with the laws of a Member State of the
European Union or of Viet Nam respectively, and engaged in substantive
business operations2 in the territory of the EU or of Viet Nam, respectively;
1 The sole fact of requiring a visa for natural persons of certain countries and not for those of others shall
not be regarded as nullifying or impairing benefits under a specific commitment.
2 In line with its notification of the Treaty establishing the European Community to the WTO
(WT/REG39/1), the EU-Party understands that the concept of “effective and continuous link” with the
economy of a Member State of the European Union enshrined in Article 54 of the TFEU is equivalent
to the concept of “substantive business operations”. Accordingly, for a juridical person set up in
accordance with the laws of Viet Nam and having only its registered office or central administration in
the territory of Viet Nam, the EU Party shall only extend the benefits of this agreement if that juridical
person possesses an effective and continuous economic link with the territory of Viet Nam.

domestic laws4;

(j) ‘services’ include any service in any sector except services supplied in the
exercise of governmental authority;
3 For greater certainty, a branch of a legal entity of a non-Party shall not be considered as an enterprise of a

required for making the related investment are completed in accordance with the applicable laws.

regulation, rule, procedure, decision, administrative action, or any other form;

(i) central, regional or local governments and authorities; and
(ii) non-governmental bodies in the exercise of powers delegated by
central, regional or local governments or authorities;
(p) 'investment'7 means every kind of asset which is owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by investors of one Party in the territory8 of the other Party, that

financing of such contract other than a loan covered by subparagraph
(iii), or any related order, judgement, or arbitral award.
7 For the purpose of the definition of investment, enterprise does not include representative office. For greater

reinvestment, including profits, dividends, capital gains, royalties, interest,
payments in connection with intellectual property rights, payments in kind and
all other lawful income.
(s) With the exception of Chapter II, Section 2 on Investment Protection,
government procurement is dealt with by Chapter on public procurement and
nothing in this Title shall be construed to limit the obligations of the Parties
under Chapter X on public procurement or to impose any additional obligation
with respect to government procurement. For greater certainty, measures with
respect to government procurement that are in compliance with Public
Procurement Chapter shall not be considered a breach of the provisions in
Section II on Investment Protection.
(t) Subsidies are dealt with by Chapter on competition and state aid. The
provisions of this Title, except for Article (Performance Requirements) and
Chapter II, Section 2 on Investment Protection, do not apply to subsidies
granted by the Parties10.
For greater certainty, a Party’s decision not to issue, renew or maintain a
subsidy or grant,
(i) in the absence of any the Party’s specific commitment to the investor under
law or contract to issue, renew, or maintain that subsidy or grant; or
(ii) in accordance with any terms or conditions attached to the issuance,
renewal or maintenance of the subsidy or grant
shall not constitute a breach of Article (Performance Requirements) or a
provision of Chapter II, Section 2 on Investment Protection.
9 For greater certainty, the Parties understand that an investor that “seeks to make” an investment refers to an
investor of any other Party that has taken active steps to make an investment, such as channelling resources or
capital in order to set up a business, or applying for permits or license.
10 The Parties understand that in the case of the EU, "subsidy" includes "state aid" as defined in the EU law and
for Viet Nam, subsidy includes investment incentives, and investment assistance such as production site
assistance, human resources training and competitiveness strengthening activities, such as assistance for
technology, research and development, legal aids, market information and promotion.

(i) investments by investors of a Party in existence in the territory the other Party as of the
date of entry into force of this Agreement or made or acquired thereafter, made in

15 For greater certainty, in the case that the investment is made in the territory of Viet Nam, “applicable law”
refers to the laws and regulations of Viet Nam
Page 11 of 90

objectives, such as the protection of public health, safety, environment or public morals,
social or consumer protection or promotion and protection of cultural diversity
2. For greater certainty, the provisions of this section shall not be interpreted as a commitment
from a Party that it will not change the legal and regulatory framework, including in a manner
that may negatively affect the operation of covered investments or the investor’s expectations
of profits.
3. For greater certainty, nothing in this Section shall be construed as preventing a Party from
discontinuing the granting of a subsidy16 and/or requesting its reimbursement, or as requiring
that Party to compensate the investor therefor, where such action has been ordered by one of
its competent authorities listed in Annex x.
Article 14
Treatment of Investment
1. Each Party shall accord fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security to
investments and investors of the other Party in its territory in accordance with paragraphs 2 to
7.

conduct. or
f. A breach of any further elements of the fair and equitable treatment obligation

act as may be reasonably necessary to protect physical security of investors and covered
investments.

the exercise of governmental authority. The conditions are:
(i) the written agreement is concluded and takes effect after the date of entry into
force of this Agreement17;
(ii) the investor relies on that written agreement in deciding to make or maintain an
investment referred to in article in Article 13. 1 (i) [Scope of section II Investment

which has been concluded and entered into force prior to the entry into force of this Agreement.

expectation, and upon which the investor relied in deciding to make or maintain that
investment, but that Party subsequently frustrated.

revolution, a state of national emergency, revolt, insurrection or riot in the territory of the

Page 14 of 90
effectively realisable, freely transferable in accordance with Article 17 (Transfers) and made

legislation
4. The issuance of compulsory licenses in relation to intellectual property rights, to the extent

Property Rights in Annex 1C to the WTO Agreements ('TRIPS Agreement'), does not
constitute expropriation for the purposes of paragraph 1) of this Article.
5. An affected investor shall have a right, under the law of the expropriating Party, to prompt
review of its claim and of the valuation of its investment, by a judicial or other independent
authority of that Party.

Annex []
Understanding on the application of paragraph 5 of the article x [Treatment of
Investment]
1. Notwithstanding the condition set forth in paragraph 5(i) of the article 14 [ Treatment of
Investment], an investor referred to in paragraph 3(a)(i) who has a dispute that falls into the
scope of Section 3 with the Party with whom it has entered into the written agreement that is
concluded and has taken effect before the entry into force of this Agreement can claim the
benefit of paragraph 5 of Article 14 [Treatment of Investment] in accordance with the
procedures and conditions set forth in this annex.
2. Written agreements that are concluded and have taken effect before the entry into force of
this Agreement and fulfill the conditions set out in this paragraph can be notified within 1
year from the date of the entry into force of this Agreement:
a. Such written agreements must satisfy all conditions set forth under ii) - iv) in paragraph 5
of Article 14 [Treatment of Investment]; and
b. Such written agreements were entered into either:
(i) by Viet Nam with investors of the EU Member States specified under paragraph 8
or their investments, referred to in Article 13. [Scope of section II Investment
Protection]; or
(ii) by one of the EU Member States specified under paragraph 8 with investors of
Viet Nam or their investments, referred to in Article 13. [Scope of section II
Investment Protection].
3. The procedure for notifying the written agreements referred to in paragraph 1 shall be as
follows:
a. Notification shall include:
(i) the name, nationality and address of the investor who is a party to the written
agreement referred in paragraph 1 being notified and the nature of the investment of
that investor, and, where the written agreement is entered into by the investment of
that investor, the name, address and place of incorporation of the investment;
(ii) a copy of the written agreement, including all of its instruments.
b. The written agreements shall be notified in writing to the competent authority designated
below:
(i) in the case of Viet Nam: the Ministry of Planning and Investment of Viet Nam.
Page 20 of 90
(ii) in the case of the EU: the European Commission.
4. The notification referred to in paragraph 1 does not create any substantive rights to the
investor who is a party to that notified written agreement or their investment.
5. The competent authorities will compile in a list the written agreements that have been
notified in accordance with the above procedure.
6. Should a dispute arise in connection with one of the above notified written agreements, the
relevant competent authority shall verify if the agreement satisfies all conditions set forth
under ii) - iv) in paragraph 5 of the article 14 [Treatment of Investment] and procedures set
forth in this Annex.
7. On the basis of that verification, should those requirements referred to in paragraph 6 of
this Annex not be met, the claim that paragraph 5 of Article 14 applies to the written
agreement shall not be admissible.
8. The EU Member States referred to in this understanding are NL, RO, UK, AT, DE, ES
Page 21 of 90
Annex [ ]
Expropriation
The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:
1. Expropriation referred to in Article 16.1 may be either direct or indirect:
a) direct expropriation occurs when an investment is nationalised or otherwise directly
expropriated through formal transfer of title or outright seizure.
b) indirect expropriation occurs where a measure or series of measures by a Party has an
effect equivalent to direct expropriation, in that it substantially deprives the investor of the
fundamental attributes of property in its investment including the right to use, enjoy and
dispose of its investment, without formal transfer of title or outright seizure.
2. The determination of whether a measure or series of measures by a Party, in a specific
factual situation, constitutes an indirect expropriation requires a case-by-case, fact-based
inquiry that considers, amongst other factors:
a) the economic impact of the measure or series of measures, although the fact
that a measure or series of measures by a Party has an adverse effect on the
economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that such
an expropriation has occurred;
b) the duration of the measure or series of measures by a Party or of its effects;
c) the character of the measure or series of measures, notably their object, context
and intent.
3. For greater certainty, except in the rare circumstances where the impact of a measure or
series of measures is so severe in light of its purpose that it appears manifestly excessive, non-
discriminatory measures or series of measures by a Party that are designed to protect
legitimate public policy objectives do not constitute indirect expropriation.
Page 22 of 90
Annex []
Public debt
1. No claim that a restructuring of debt of a Party breaches an obligation under Section 2
[Investment Protection] may be submitted to, or if already submitted, be pursued under
Section 3 [Resolution of Investment Disputes and Investment Court System] if the
restructuring is a negotiated restructuring at the time of submission, or becomes a
negotiated restructuring after such submission.
2. Notwithstanding [Article 6 Submission of a Claim, Section on Resolution of Investment
Disputes and Investment Court System], and subject to paragraph 1 of this Annex, an
investor may not submit a claim under Section 3 [Resolution of Investment Disputes and
Investment Court System] that a restructuring of debt of a Party breaches Articles X
[National Treatment] or X [Most-Favoured Nation] of Section 1 [Liberalisation of
Investments]21 or an obligation under Section 2 [Investment Protection], unless 270 days
have elapsed from the date of submission by the claimant of the written request for
consultations pursuant to [Article 4 Consultations].
3. For the purposes of this Annex:
- ‘negotiated restructuring’ means the restructuring or rescheduling of debt of a Party that
has been effected through (i) a modification or amendment of debt instruments, as
provided for under their terms, including their governing law, or (ii) a debt exchange or
other similar process in which the holders of no less than 66% of the aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding debt subject to restructuring, excluding debt held by that Party
or by entities owned or controlled by it, have consented to such debt exchange or other
process.
- "governing law" of a debt instrument means a country's legal and regulatory framework
applicable to that debt instrument.
4. For greater certainty, “debt of a Party” includes, in the case of the European Union, debt
of a government of a Member State, or of a Government in a Member State, at the central,
regional or local level.
21 For greater certainty, a breach of the Article [National Treatment] or Article [Most-Favoured Nation] does not
occur merely by virtue of a different treatment provided by a Party to certain categories of investors or
investments on grounds of a different macroeconomic impact, for instance to avoid systemic risks or spillover
effects, or on grounds of eligibility for debt restructuring.

Page 27 of 90
Section. This period may be extended by agreement between the parties involved in the
consultations.
6. The time periods in paragraphs 2 and 5 shall not render claims inadmissible where the
claimant can demonstrate that the failure to request consultations or submit a claim is due to
the claimant's inability to act as a result of actions deliberately taken by the Party concerned,
provided that the claimant acts as soon as reasonably possible after it is able to act.
7. In the event that the request for consultations concerns an alleged breach of the agreement
by the European Union, or by a Member State of the European Union, it shall be sent to the

the European Union, nor of Vietnam.
5. Once the disputing parties agree to have recourse to mediation, the time limits set out in

Upon request of both disputing parties, where a division of the Tribunal has been established
pursuant to Article 12 (Tribunal), the division shall stay its proceedings until the date on
which either party to the dispute decides to terminate the mediation, by way of a letter to the
mediator and the other disputing party.
SUB-SECTION 3: SUBMISSION OF A CLAIM AND CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

3. The claimant may submit a claim pursuant to Article 7 on the basis of such determination.
4. Where either the European Union or the Member State is respondent following a
determination made pursuant to paragraph 2, neither the European Union, nor the Member

Tribunal or otherwise assert that the claim or award is unfounded or invalid on the ground that
the proper respondent should be the European Union rather than the Member State or vice
versa.
5. The Tribunal and the Appeal Tribunal shall be bound by the determination made pursuant
to paragraph 2.
6. Nothing in this Agreement or the applicable rules on dispute settlement shall prevent the
exchange of all information relating to a dispute between the European Union and the

2. A claimant acting on its own behalf may not submit a claim to the Tribunal if any person

disputing parties, take into account proceedings pursuant to Section X [State to State dispute

Agreement, appoint nine Members of the Tribunal. Three of the Members shall be nationals
of a Member State of the European Union, three shall be nationals of Vietnam and three shall
be nationals of third countries.25
3. The Trade Committee may decide to increase or to decrease the number of the Members of

as provided for in paragraph 2.
25 Instead of proposing the appointment of three Members who have its nationality or citizenship, either Party
may propose to appoint up to three Members who have another nationality or citizenship. In this case, such
Members shall be considered to be nationals or citizens of the Party that proposed his or her appointment for the
purposes of this Article.
Page 33 of 90
4. The Members of the Tribunal shall possess the qualifications required in their respective
countries for appointment to judicial offices, or be jurists of recognised competence. They

expertise in particular, in international investment law, international trade law and the
resolution of disputes arising under international investment or international trade agreements.

four-year term, renewable once. However, the terms of five of the nine persons appointed
immediately after the entry into force of the Agreement, to be determined by lot, shall extend
to six years. Vacancies shall be filled as they arise. A person appointed to replace a person
whose term of office has not expired shall hold office for the remainder of the predecessor's
term. A person who is serving on a division of the Tribunal when his or her term expires may,
with the authorization of the President of the Tribunal, continue to serve on the division until
the closure of the proceedings of that division and shall, for that purpose only, be deemed to
continue to be a Member of the Tribunal.
6. The Tribunal shall hear cases in divisions consisting of three Members, of whom one shall
be a national of a Member State of the European Union, one a national of Vietnam and one a
national of a third country. The division shall be chaired by the Member who is a national of a

Tribunal shall appoint the Members composing the division of the Tribunal hearing the case
on a rotation basis, ensuring that the composition of the divisions is random and
unpredictable, while giving equal opportunity to all Members to serve.
8. The President and Vice-President of the Tribunal shall be responsible for organisational
issues and will be appointed for a two-year term and shall be drawn by lot from among the
Members who are nationals of third countries. They shall serve on the basis of a rotation

President when the President is unavailable.
9. Notwithstanding paragraph 6, the disputing parties may agree that a case be heard by a sole
Member who is a national of a third country, to be selected by the President of the Tribunal.
The respondent shall give sympathetic consideration to such a request from the claimant, in
particular where the claimant is a small or medium-sized enterprise or the compensation or
damages claimed are relatively low. Such a request should be made at the same time as the
filing of the claim pursuant to Article 7.
10. The Tribunal may draw up its own working procedures. Such Working Procedures shall
be compatible with the applicable dispute settlement rules and the provisions of this Section.

Procedures to the Committee on Services, Investment and Government Procurement. The
Working Procedures shall be adopted by the Trade Committee on agreement of the Parties. If
the draft Working Procedures are not adopted by the Trade Committee within three months
Page 34 of 90
after their presentation to the Committee on Services, Investment and Government
Procurement, the President of the Tribunal shall make the necessary revision to the draft
Working Procedures, taking into consideration the views expressed by the Parties. The
President of the Tribunal shall subsequently present the revised version of the Working
Procedures to the Committee on Services, Investment and Government Procurement. The
Working procedures shall be considered adopted, unless the Parties, through a decision of the
Trade Committee, reject the draft Working Procedures within three months after their
presentation to the Committee on Services, Investment and Government Procurement.
11. Where a procedural question arises that is not covered by this Section, any supplemental
rules adopted by the Trade Committee or by the Working Procedures drawn up by the
Tribunal, the relevant division of the Tribunal may adopt an appropriate procedure that is
compatible with those provisions.
12. A division of the Tribunal shall make every effort to make any decision by consensus.
Where, nevertheless, a decision cannot be arrived at by consensus, a division of the Tribunal
shall render its decision by a majority of votes of all its Members. Opinions expressed by
individual Members of a division of the Tribunal shall be anonymous.
13. The Members shall be available at all times and on short notice, and shall stay abreast of
dispute settlement activities under this Agreement.
14. In order to ensure their availability, the Members shall be paid a monthly retainer fee to be
fixed by decision of the Trade Committee. The President of the Tribunal and, where
applicable, the Vice-President, shall receive a daily fee equivalent to the fee determined
pursuant to Article 13(16) for each day worked in fulfilling the functions of President of the
Tribunal pursuant to this Section.
15. The retainer fee and the daily fees for the President or Vice President of the Tribunal
when working in fulfilling the functions of President of the Tribunal pursuant to this Section
shall be paid by both Parties taking into account their respective levels of development into an
account managed by the [Secretariat of ICSID/ Permanent Court of Arbitration] [Negotiators'
note: to be decided during legal scrubbing]. In the event that one Party fails to pay the retainer
fee the other Party may elect to pay. Any such arrears will remain payable, with appropriate
interest.
16. Unless the Trade Committee adopts a decision pursuant to paragraph 17, the amount of
the other fees and expenses of the Members on a division of the Investment Tribunal shall be
those determined pursuant to Regulation 14(1) of the Administrative and Financial
Regulations of the ICSID Convention in force on the date of the submission of the claim and
allocated by the Tribunal among the disputing parties in accordance with Article 27(4).
17. Upon a decision by the Trade Committee, the retainer fee and other fees and expenses
may be permanently transformed into a regular salary. In such an event, the Members shall
serve on a full-time basis and the Trade Committee shall fix their remuneration and related
organisational matters. In that event, the Members of the Tribunal shall not be permitted to
Page 35 of 90
engage in any occupation, whether gainful or not, unless exemption is exceptionally granted
by the President of the Tribunal.
18. The [Secretariat of ICSID/Permanent Court of Arbitration] [Negotiators' note: to be

Procurement. The Working procedures shall be considered adopted, unless the Parties,
through a decision of the Trade Committee, reject the draft Working Procedures within three

Tribunal, the relevant division of the Appeal Tribunal may adopt an appropriate procedure
that is compatible with those provisions.

Article 14
Ethics
1. The Members of the Tribunal and of the Appeal Tribunal shall be chosen from persons
whose independence is beyond doubt. They shall not be affiliated with any government.27
They shall not take instructions from any government or organisation with regard to matters
related to the dispute. They shall not participate in the consideration of any disputes that
27 For greater certainty, the fact that a person receives an income from the government, or was formerly
employed by the government, or has family relationship with a person who receives an income from the
government, does not in itself render that person ineligible.
Page 38 of 90
would create a direct or indirect conflict of interest. In so doing they shall comply with Annex
II (Code of Conduct). In addition, upon appointment, they shall refrain from acting as counsel
or as party-appointed expert or witness in any pending or new investment protection dispute
under this or any other agreement or domestic law.
2. If a disputing party considers that a Member has a conflict of interest, it shall send a notice
of challenge to the appointment to the President of the Tribunal or to the President of the
Appeal Tribunal, respectively. The notice of challenge shall be sent within 15 days of the date
on which the composition of the division of the Tribunal or of the Appeal Tribunal has been
communicated to the disputing party, or within 15 days of the date on which the relevant facts
came to its knowledge, if they could not have reasonably been known at the time of
composition of the division. The notice of challenge shall state the grounds for the challenge.
3. If, within 15 days from the date of the notice of challenge, the challenged Member has
elected not to resign from that division, the President of the Tribunal or the President of the
Appeal Tribunal, respectively, shall, after hearing the disputing parties and after providing the
Member an opportunity to submit any observations, issue a decision within 45 days of receipt
of the notice of challenge and forthwith notify the disputing parties and other Members of the
division.

decided by the President of the Appeal Tribunal and vice-versa.
5. Upon a reasoned recommendation from the President of the Appeal Tribunal, or on their
joint initiative, the Parties, by decision of the Trade Committee, may decide to remove a
Member from the Tribunal or a Member from the Appeal Tribunal where his behaviour is
inconsistent with the obligations set out in paragraph 1 and incompatible with his continued
membership of the Tribunal or Appeal Tribunal. If the behaviour in question is alleged to be
that of the President of the Appeal Tribunal then the President of the Tribunal shall submit the
reasoned recommendation. Articles 12(2) and 13(3) shall apply mutatis mutandis for filling
vacancies that may arise pursuant to this paragraph.
Article 15
Multilateral dispute settlement mechanisms
The Parties shall enter into negotiations for an international agreement providing for a
multilateral investment tribunal in combination with, or separate from, a multilateral
appellate mechanism applicable to disputes under this Agreement. The Parties may

Article 16
Applicable law and rules of Interpretation
1. The Tribunal shall determine whether the measures in question are inconsistent with the
provisions referred to in Article 1(1) (Scope).
2. When rendering its decisions, the Tribunal shall apply the provisions referred to in Article
1(1) (Scope) and other provisions of this agreement as applicable, as well as other rules or
principles of international law applicable between the Parties, and take into consideration, as
matter of fact, any relevant domestic law of the disputing Party. For greater certainty, the
Tribunal shall be bound by the interpretation given to the domestic law by the courts or
authorities who are competent to interpret the relevant domestic law, and any meaning given
to the relevant domestic law made by the Tribunal shall not be binding upon the courts and
the authorities of either Party. The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to determine the
legality of a measure, alleged to constitute a breach of this Agreement, under the domestic law
of the disputing Party.
3. In making its determination, the Tribunal shall interpret the provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with customary rules of interpretation of public international law, as codified in
the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
4. Where serious concerns arise as regards issues of interpretation which may affect matters
relating this Chapter, the Trade Committee may adopt interpretations of provisions of this
Agreement. Any such interpretation shall be binding upon the Tribunal and the Appeal
Tribunal. The Trade Committee may decide that an interpretation shall have binding effect
from a specific date.
Article 17
Anti-Circumvention
For greater certainty, the Tribunal shall decline jurisdiction where the dispute had arisen, or
was foreseeable on the basis of a high degree of probability, at the time when the claimant
acquired ownership or control of the investment subject to the dispute and the Tribunal
determines, on the basis of the facts of the case, that the claimant has acquired ownership or
control of the investment for the main purpose of submitting the claim under this Section. The
possibility to decline jurisdiction in such circumstances is without prejudice to other
jurisdictional objections which could be entertained by the Tribunal.
Article 18
Preliminary Objections
1. The respondent may, no later than 30 days after the constitution of the division of Tribunal
pursuant to Article 12, and in any event before the first session of the division of the Tribunal,
Page 40 of 90
or 30 days after the respondent became aware of the facts on which the objection is based, file
an objection that a claim is manifestly without legal merit.
2. The respondent shall specify as precisely as possible the basis for the objection.
3. The Tribunal, after giving the disputing parties an opportunity to present their observations
on the objection, shall, at the first meeting of the division of the Tribunal or promptly
thereafter, issue a decision or provisional award on the objection, stating the grounds therefor.
In the event that the objection is received after the first meeting of the division of the Tribunal,
the Tribunal shall issue such decision or provisional award as soon as possible, and no later
than 120 days after the objection was filed. In doing so, the Tribunal shall assume the alleged
facts to be true, and may also consider any relevant facts not in dispute.
4. The decision of the tribunal shall be without prejudice to the right of a disputing party to
object, pursuant to article 19 (Claims unfounded as a Matter of Law) or in the course of the
proceeding, to the legal merits of a claim and without prejudice to a Tribunal's authority to
address other objections as a preliminary question. For greater certainty, such objection may
include an objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal.
Article 19
Claims Unfounded as a Matter of Law
1. Without prejudice to the Tribunal’s authority to address other objections as a preliminary
question, such as an objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal
or to a respondent’s right to raise any such objections at any appropriate time, the Tribunal
shall address and decide as a preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a
matter of law, a claim, or any part thereof, submitted under this section is not a claim for
which an award in favour of the claimant may be made under Article 27 (Provisional Award),
even if the facts alleged were assumed to be true. The Tribunal may also consider any relevant
facts not in dispute.
2. An objection under paragraph 1 shall be submitted to the Tribunal as soon as possible after
the division of the Tribunal is constituted, and in no event later than the date the Tribunal
fixes for the respondent to submit its counter-memorial or statement of defence or, in the case
of an amendment to the claim, the date the Tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its
response to the amendment. An objection may not be submitted under paragraph 1 as long as
proceedings under Article 18 (Preliminary objections) are pending, unless the Tribunal grants
leave to file an objection under this article, after having taken due account of the
circumstances of the case.
3. On receipt of an objection under paragraph 1, and unless it considers the objection
manifestly unfounded, the Tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits, establish a
schedule for considering the objection consistent with any schedule it has established for
Page 41 of 90
considering any other preliminary question, and issue a decision or provisional award on the
objection, stating the grounds therefor.
Article 20
Transparency of proceedings
1. The UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration (the
“UNCITRAL Transparency Rules”) shall apply to disputes under this Section, subject to the
following rules:

determination under Article 6, the notice of challenge and the decision on challenge under
Article 14, and the request for consolidation under Article 33 shall be included in the list of
documents referred to in Article 3(1) of the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules.
3. Subject to Article 7 of the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules, the Tribunal may decide, on
its own initiative or upon request from any person, and after consultation with the disputing

the Tribunal not falling within Article 3(1) and 3(2) of the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules.
This may include exhibits when the respondent so agrees.
4. Notwithstanding Article 2 of the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules, the European Union or
Viet Nam as the case may be shall, after receiving the relevant documents pursuant to
paragraph 2, promptly transmit them to the non-disputing Party and make them publicly
available, subject to the redaction of confidential or protected information28.
5. Documents referred to in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 may be made publicly available by
communication to the repository referred to in the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules or
otherwise.
6. No later than three years after the entry into force of this Agreement, the Trade Committee
shall review the operation of paragraph 3 above. Upon request of either Party, the Trade
Committee may adopt a decision pursuant to Article 34(2)(d) stipulating that Article 3(3) of
the UNCITRAL transparency rules will apply instead of paragraph 3.
7. Subject to any decision by the Tribunal on an objection regarding the designation of
information claimed to be confidential or protected information, neither the disputing parties
nor the Tribunal shall disclose to any non-disputing Party or to the public any protected
information where the disputing party that provided the information clearly designates it as
such29.
28 For greater certainty, confidential or protected information, as defined in Article 7(2) of the UNCITRAL
Transparency Rules, includes classified government information.
29 For greater certainty, where a disputing party that submitted the information decides to withdraw all or parts of
its submission containing such information in accordance with Article 7(4) of the UNCITRAL Transparency
Rules, the other disputing party shall, whenever necessary, resubmit complete and redacted documents which
Page 42 of 90
8. A disputing party may disclose to other persons in connection with proceedings, including
witnesses and experts, such unredacted documents as it considers necessary in the course of
proceedings under this Section. However, the disputing party shall ensure that those persons
protect the confidential or protected information in those documents.
Article 21
Interim decisions
The Tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing
party or to ensure that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to
preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the Tribunal's
jurisdiction. The Tribunal may not order the seizure of assets nor may it prevent the
application of the treatment alleged to constitute a breach. For the purpose of this paragraph,
an order includes a recommendation.
Article 22
Security for costs
1. For greater certainty, upon request, the Tribunal may order the claimant to post security for
all or a part of the costs if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the claimant risks not
being able to honour a possible decision on costs issued against the claimant.
2. If the security for costs is not posted in full within 30 days after the Tribunal’s order, or
within any other time period set by the Tribunal, the Tribunal shall so inform the disputing
parties. The Tribunal may order the suspension or termination of the proceedings.
Article 23
Discontinuance
If, following the submission of a claim under this section, the claimant fails to take any steps
in the proceeding during 180 consecutive days or such periods as the disputing parties may
agree, the claimant shall be deemed to have withdrawn its claim and to have discontinued the
proceedings. The Tribunal shall, at the request of the respondent, and after notice to the
disputing parties, in an order take note of the discontinuance. After such an order has been
rendered the authority of the Tribunal shall lapse. The claimant may not subsequently submit
a claim on the same matter.
Article 24
Language of the Proceedings
1. The disputing parties shall agree on the language to be used in the proceedings.
either remove the information withdrawn by the disputing party that first submitted the information or
redesignate the information consistent with the designation of the disputing party that first submitted the
information.
Page 43 of 90
2. If the disputing parties have not reached an agreement pursuant to paragraph 1 within 30
days of the constitution of the division of the Tribunal pursuant to Article 12(7), the Tribunal
shall determine the language to be used in the proceedings. The Tribunal shall make its
determination after consulting the disputing parties with a view to ensure the economic
efficiency of the proceedings and ensure that its determination does not impose any
unnecessary burden on the resources of the disputing parties and of the Tribunal.30
Article 25
The non-disputing Party
1. The respondent shall, within 30 days after receipt or promptly after any dispute concerning
confidential or protected information has been resolved, deliver to the non-disputing Party:
a) a request for consultations referred to in Article 4 (Consultations), a notice of intent and a
notice requesting a determination referred to in Article 6 (Notice of intent to submit a claim)
and a claim referred to in Article 7 (Submission of a Claim);
b) on request any documents that are made available to the public in accordance with Article
20 (Transparency of Proceedings).
2. The non-disputing Party has the right to attend a hearing held under this Section and to
make oral representations relating to the interpretation of this Agreement.
Article 26
Expert Reports
The Tribunal, at the request of a disputing party or, after consulting the disputing parties, on
its own initiative, may appoint one or more experts to report to it in writing on any factual
issue concerning environmental, health, safety, or other matters raised by a disputing party in
a proceeding.
Article 27
Provisional Award
1. Where the Tribunal concludes that a measure in dispute breaches any of the provisions
referred to in Article 1(1) (Scope), the Tribunal may, on the basis of a request from the
claimant, and after hearing the disputing parties, award only:
(a) monetary damages and any applicable interest;
(b) restitution of property, in which case the award shall provide that the respondent may
pay monetary damages and any applicable interest in lieu of restitution, determined in a
manner consistent with the relevant provisions of Section II (Investment Protection).
30 In considering the economic efficiency of the proceedings, the Tribunal should take into account the costs of
the disputing parties and of the Tribunal in processing case-law and legal writings which will potentially be
submitted by the disputing parties.
Page 44 of 90
Where the claim was submitted on behalf of a locally-established company, any award under
this paragraph shall provide that:
(a) any monetary damages and interest shall be paid to the locally established company;
(b) any restitution shall be made to the locally established company.
The Tribunal may not order the repeal of the treatment concerned.
2. Monetary damages shall not be greater than the loss suffered by the claimant or, as
applicable by its locally established company, as a result of the breach of the relevant
provisions of the agreement, reduced by any prior damages or compensation already provided
by the Party concerned. For greater certainty, when an investor submits a claim on its own
behalf, it may recover only loss or damage that it has incurred with regards to its investment
as referred to in Article (Scope) of Section II (Investment Protection).
3. The Tribunal may not award punitive damages.
4. The Tribunal shall order that the costs of proceedings31 be borne by the unsuccessful
disputing party. In exceptional circumstances, the Tribunal may apportion costs between the
disputing parties if it determines that apportionment is appropriate in the circumstance of the
case. Other reasonable costs, including reasonable costs of legal representation and assistance,
shall be borne by the unsuccessful disputing party, unless the Tribunal determines that such
apportionment is unreasonable in the circumstances of the case. Where only some parts of the
claims have been successful the costs shall be adjusted, proportionately, to the number or
extent of the successful parts of the claims. The Appeal Tribunal shall deal with costs in
accordance with this article.

sized enterprise. The Trade Committee shall endeavour to adopt such supplemental rules no
later than one year after the entry into force of this Agreement.

the claim. If that deadline cannot be respected, the Tribunal shall adopt a decision to that
effect, which will specify the reasons for such delay.

Article 28
Appeal procedure
1. Either disputing party may appeal before the Appeal Tribunal a provisional award, within
90 days of its issuance. The grounds for appeal are:
(a) that the Tribunal has erred in the interpretation or application of the applicable law;
(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly erred in the appreciation of the facts, including the
appreciation of relevant domestic law; or,
(c) those provided for in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, in so far as they are not
covered by (a) and (b).
2. The Appeal Tribunal shall reject the appeal where it finds that the appeal is unfounded. It
may also dismiss the appeal on an expedited basis where it is clear that the appeal is
manifestly unfounded.
3. If the Appeal Tribunal finds that the appeal is well founded, the decision of the Appeal
Tribunal shall modify or reverse the legal findings and conclusions in the provisional award in
whole or part. Its decision shall specify precisely how it has modified or reversed the relevant
findings and conclusions of the Tribunal.
4. Where the facts established by the Tribunal so permit, the Appeal Tribunal shall apply its
own legal findings and conclusions to such facts and render a final decision on the matter.
Where this is not possible, it shall refer the matter back to the Tribunal.
5. As a general rule, the appeal proceedings shall not exceed 180 days from the date a party to
the dispute formally notifies its decision to appeal to the date the Appeal Tribunal issues its
decision. When the Appeal Tribunal considers that it cannot issue its decision within 180
days, it shall inform the disputing parties in writing of the reasons for the delay together with
an estimate of the period within which it will issue its decision. In no case should the
proceedings exceed 270 days.
6. A disputing party lodging an appeal shall provide security, including the costs of appeal, as
well as a reasonable amount determined by the Appeal Tribunal in light of the circumstances
of the case.
7. The provisions of Articles 11 [Third-Party Funding], 20 [Transparency], 21 [Interim
decisions], 23 [Discontinuance] and 25 [The non-disputing Party] shall apply mutatis
mutandis in respect of the appeal procedure.

Article 29
Final Award

the date of rejection or dismissal of the appeal by the Appeal Tribunal.
3. Where a provisional award has been appealed and the Appeal Tribunal has rendered a final
decision on the matter, the provisional award as modified or reversed by the Appeal Tribunal
shall become final on the date of the issuance of the final decision of the Appeal Tribunal.
4. Where a provisional award has been appealed and the Appeal Tribunal has modified or
reversed the legal findings and conclusions of the provisional award and referred the matter
back to the Tribunal, the Tribunal shall, after hearing the disputing parties if appropriate,
revise its provisional award to reflect the findings and conclusions of the Appeal Tribunal.
The Tribunal shall be bound by the findings made by the Appeal Tribunal. The Tribunal shall
seek to issue its revised award within 90 days of receiving the report of the Appeal Tribunal.
The revised provisional award will become final 90 days after its issuance.

Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 10th June, 1958 (New York Convention). During
this time, paragraph 1(b) of this Article and paragraph 3(b) of Article 10 (Consent) do not
apply to disputes where Viet Nam is a respondent.
4. Upon completion of a period of 5 years after the entry into force of this Agreement, or a
longer period fixed by the Trade Committee should the conditions warrant, the recognition
and enforcement of a final award in respect of disputes where Viet Nam is the respondent
shall be in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2.
5. Execution of the award shall be governed by the laws concerning the execution of
judgments or awards in force where such execution is sought.

dispute settlement pursuant to Article 7(2)(a), a final award issued pursuant to this Section
shall qualify as an award under Section 6 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment
Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States of 18 March 1965 (ICSID).
Article 32

with the award rendered in such dispute. Diplomatic protection, for the purpose of this
paragraph, shall not include informal diplomatic exchanges for the sole purpose of facilitating
a settlement of the dispute.
2. Paragraph 1 shall not exclude the possibility of dispute settlement under [Chapter X state-
to-state dispute settlement] in respect of a measure of general application even if that measure
is alleged to have breached the agreement as regards a specific investment in respect of which
a dispute has been initiated pursuant to Article 7 and is without prejudice to Article 25 of this
Section or Article 5 of the UNICTRAL Transparency Rules.
Page 48 of 90
Article 33
Consolidation
1. In the event that two or more claims submitted under this Section have a question of law or
fact in common and arise out of the same events and circumstances, the respondent may
submit to the President of the Tribunal a request for the consolidation of such claims or part of
them. The request shall stipulate:
(a) the names and addresses of the disputing parties to the claims sought to be consolidated;
(b) the scope of the consolidation sought; and
(c) the grounds for the request.
The respondent shall deliver the request to each claimant in a claim which the respondent
seeks to consolidate.
2. In the event that all disputing parties to the claims sought to be consolidated agree to the
consolidation of the claims, the disputing parties shall submit a joint request to the President
of the Tribunal pursuant to paragraph 1. The President of the Tribunal shall, after receipt of
such joint request, constitute a new division (the “consolidating division”) of the Tribunal
pursuant to Article 12 which shall have jurisdiction over all or part of the claims which are
subject to the joint consolidation request.
3. In the event that the disputing parties referred to in paragraph 2 have not reached an
agreement on consolidation within thirty days of the receipt of the request for consolidation
referred to in paragraph 1 by the last claimant to receive it, the President of the Tribunal shall
constitute a consolidating division of the Tribunal pursuant to Article 12. The consolidating
division shall assume jurisdiction over all or part of the claims, if, after considering the views
of the disputing parties, it decides that to do so would best serve the interest of fair and
efficient resolution of the claims, including the interest of consistency of awards.
4. The consolidating division shall conduct its proceedings under the dispute settlement rules
chosen by agreement of the claimants from those referred to in Article 7(2).
5. If the claimants have not agreed upon the dispute settlement rules within 30 days of the
date of receipt of the request for consolidation by the last claimant to receive it, the
consolidating division shall conduct its proceedings under application of the UNCITRAL
arbitration rules.
6. Divisions of the Tribunal constituted under Article 12 shall cede jurisdiction in relation to
the claims, or parts thereof, over which the consolidating division has jurisdiction and the
proceedings of such divisions shall be stayed or adjourned, as appropriate. The award of the
consolidating division of the Tribunal in relation to the parts of the claims over which it has
assumed jurisdiction shall be binding on the divisions which have jurisdiction over the
remainder of the claims, as of the date the award becomes final pursuant to Article 29.
Page 49 of 90
7. A claimant may withdraw the claim or the part thereof subject to consolidation from
dispute settlement proceedings under this Article and such claim or part thereof may not be
resubmitted under Article 7.
8. At the request of the respondent, the consolidating division of the Tribunal, on the same
basis and with the same effect as paragraph 3 and 6 above, may decide whether to assume
jurisdiction over all or part of a claim falling within the scope of paragraph 1 above, which is
submitted after the initiation of consolidation proceedings.
9. At the request of one of the claimants, the consolidating division of the Tribunal may take
such measures as it sees fit in order to preserve the confidentiality of protected information of
that claimant vis-à-vis other claimants. Such measures may include the submission of
redacted versions of documents containing protected information to the other claimants or
arrangements to hold parts of the hearing in private.

ANNEX III
1. Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of Article 8 (Other claims), an investor of the EU may not
submit to the Tribunal under Section 3 a claim that Viet Nam has breached a provision under
Article 1.1 (Scope) if the investor has submitted a claim alleging a breach of the same
provision under Article 1.1 (Scope) in proceedings before a court or administrative tribunal of
Viet Nam or any international arbitration.35

Page 68 of 90
2. These disciplines shall only apply to sectors for which the Party has undertaken specific
commitments and to the extent that these specific commitments apply.
3. These disciplines do not apply to measures to the extent that they constitute limitations
subject to scheduling under Article (…) (Market Access) and/or Article (…) (National
Treatment).
4. For the purpose of this Section,
(b) ‘Licencing requirements’ are substantive requirements, other than qualification

persons for business purposes. Where such procedures are not independent of the agency
entrusted with the administrative decision concerned, each Party shall ensure that the
procedures in fact provide for an objective and impartial review.
This paragraph shall not be construed to require a Party to institute such tribunals or
procedures where this would be inconsistent with its constitutional structure or the nature of
its legal system.
Article (…)
Licencing and qualification procedures
1. Licencing and qualification procedures and formalities shall not in themselves constitute a
restriction on the supply of the service or the pursuit of any other economic activity. Each
Party shall endeavour to make such procedures and formalities as simple as possible and shall
not unduly complicate or delay the provision of the service. Any licencing fees50 which the
applicants may incur from their application should be reasonable and do not, in themselves,
restrict the supply of the relevant service.
2. Each party shall ensure that the procedures used by, and the decisions of, the competent
authority in the licencing or authorisation process are impartial with respect to all applicants.
The competent authority should reach its decision in an independent manner and not be
accountable to any person supplying the services or carrying out the economic activities for
which the licence or authorisation is required.
3. Where specific time periods for applications exist in each Party's laws and regulations, an
applicant shall be allowed a reasonable period for the submission of an application. The

7. If an application is rejected by the competent authority, the applicant shall be informed in
writing and without undue delay. In principle, the applicant shall, upon formal request, also be
informed of the reasons for rejection of the application. An applicant should be permitted,
within reasonable time limits, to resubmit an application.

SECTION II PROVISIONS OF GENERAL APPLICATION
Article (…)
Mutual recognition of Professional Qualifications
1. Nothing in this Article shall prevent a Party from requiring that natural persons possess the
necessary qualifications and/or professional experience specified in the territory where the service
is supplied, for the sector of activity concerned.
2. The Parties shall encourage the relevant professional bodies or respective authorities as
appropriate, in their respective territories to develop and provide a joint recommendation on
mutual recognition to the Committee on Trade in Services, Investment and Government
Procurement established pursuant to Article 17.2 (Specialised Committees). Such a
recommendation shall be supported by evidence on:
(a) the economic value of an envisaged an agreement on mutual recognition of professional
qualifications (hereinafter referred to as “Mutual Recognition Agreement”); and
(b) the compatibility of the respective regimes, i.e., the extent to which the criteria applied by each
Party for the authorisation, licensing, operation and certification of entrepreneurs and service

following paragraphs.
Page 71 of 90
2. CPC51 84, the United Nations code used for describing computer and related services,
covers the basic functions used to provide all computer and related services.
Technological developments have led to the increased offering of these services as a
bundle or package of related services that can include some or all of these basic
functions. For example, services such as web or domain hosting, data mining services
and grid computing each consist of a combination of basic computer services
functions.
3. Computer and related services, regardless of whether they are delivered via a network,
including the Internet, include all services that provide:
(a) consulting, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design, development,
installation, implementation, integration, testing, debugging, updating, support,
technical assistance, or management of or for computers or computer systems;
or
(b) consulting, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design, development,
installation, implementation, integration, testing, debugging, updating,
adaptation, maintenance, support, technical assistance, management or use of

(d) maintenance and repair services for office machinery and equipment, including
computers; or,
(e) training services for staff of clients, related to computer programmes,
computers or computer systems, and not elsewhere classified.

provision of other services52 by both electronic and other means. However, in such
cases, there is an important distinction between the computer and related services (e.g.
web-hosting or application hosting) and the other service53 enabled by the computer
and related service. The other service, regardless of whether it is enabled by a
computer and related service, is not covered by CPC 84.
SECTION IV POSTAL SERVICES54
51 CPC means the Central Products Classification as set out in Statistical Office of the United Nations,
Statistical Papers, Series M, N° 77, CPC prov, 1991.
