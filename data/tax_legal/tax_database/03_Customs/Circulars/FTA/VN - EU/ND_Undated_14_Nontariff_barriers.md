CHAPTER ON NON-TARIFF BARRIERS TO TRADE AND INVESTMENT IN RENEWABLE
ENERGY GENERATION
ARTICLE 1:
OBJECTIVES
In line with global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the Parties share the
objective of promoting, developing and increasing the generation of energy from
renewable and sustainable sources, particularly through facilitating trade and
investment. To this effect, the Parties shall cooperate towards removing or reducing
non-tariff barriers and fostering cooperation, taking into account, where appropriate,
regional and international standards.
ARTICLE 2:
DEFINITIONS
For the purposes of this Annex/Chapter:
(a) local content requirement means –
- with respect to goods, a requirement for an enterprise to purchase
or use goods of domestic origin or from a domestic source,
whether specified in terms of particular products, in terms of
volume or value of products, or in terms of a proportion of volume
or value of its local production;
- with respect to services, a requirement which restricts the choice
of the service supplier or the service supplied to the detriment of
services or service suppliers from the other Party;
(b) offset means any undertakings that require use of local content, local
suppliers, technology transfer, investment, counter-trade or similar
actions to encourage local development;
(c) partnerships means any legal entity such as a joint venture, a 100%
foreign-owned enterprise or a partnership according to domestic law;
(d) service suppliers shall be defined as in the Chapter on Services,
Establishment, and E-Commerce; and
(f) renewable and sustainable sources consist of wind, solar, geothermal,
hydrothermal and ocean energy, hydropower with capacity of 50 MW or
less, biomass, landfill gas, sewage treatment plant gas and biogases but
not the products from which energy is generated.
ARTICLE 3:
SCOPE
1. This Annex shall apply to measures which affect trade and investment between
the Parties related to the generation of energy from renewable and sustainable
sources.
2. This Annex shall not apply to research and development projects, nor
demonstration projects carried out on a non-commercial scale.
3. Subject to paragraph 4 of this Article, this Annex is without prejudice to the
application of any other relevant provisions of this Agreement, including any
exceptions, reservations or restrictions thereto, to the measures mentioned in
Paragraph 1, mutatis mutandis. For greater certainty, in the event of an inconsistency
between this Annex and other provisions of this Agreement, those provisions shall
prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.
4. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Chapter on [Investment] of the Title on
Trade in Services, Investment and E-Commerce, including reservations thereto, the
Parties shall apply the provisions of Article 4(1)a and Article 4(1)b of this
Annex/Chapter starting from the date of five (5) years after the entry into force of
this agreement.
5. This Annex shall not apply to projects funded and governed by an agreement with
an international organisation or foreign government to which procedures or conditions
of the international organizations or donors apply.
ARTICLE 4:
PRINCIPLES
(1) A Party shall:
(a) refrain from adopting measures providing for local content requirements
or any other offset affecting the other Party's products, service suppliers,
investors or investments;
(b) refrain from adopting measures requiring to form partnerships with local
companies, unless such partnerships are deemed necessary for technical
reasons and the Party can demonstrate these upon request by the other
2
Party;
(c) ensure that any measures concerning the authorisation, certification and
licensing procedures that are applied, in particular, to equipment, plants
and associated transmission network infrastructures, are objective,
transparent, non-arbitrary and do not discriminate between applicants
from the Parties;
(d) ensure that administrative charges imposed on or in connection with the
–
i. importation and use of products originating in the other Party, by
the other Party's suppliers are subject to the provisions of Art
[XTiG Chapter]; and
ii. provision of services by the other Party's suppliers are subject to
the provisions of Art X [subsection on Domestic Regulation in the
Chapter on Services, Establishment and E-Commerce]; and
(e) ensure that the terms, conditions and procedures for the connection and
access to electricity transmission grids are transparent and do not
discriminate against suppliers of the other Party.
ARTICLE 5:
STANDARDS, TECHNICAL REGULATIONS AND CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT
1. This Article applies to the products that are listed in the List of Products attached
to this Annex. Upon mutual agreement by the Parties, this List of Products may be
extended to include other products by a simple exchange of letters.
2. Where relevant international standards established by the International
Organization for Standards (ISO) or the International Electrotechnical Commission
(IEC) exist the Parties shall use these international standards, or their relevant parts,
as a basis for any standard, technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure,
except when such international standards or relevant parts would be an ineffective or
inappropriate means for the fulfilment of the legitimate objectives pursued. In those
cases, a Party shall, upon request from the other Party, identify the part of the
respective standard, technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure which
substantially deviate from the relevant international standard and provide justification
as to the reasons for the deviation.
3. Where appropriate, the Parties shall specify technical regulations based on
product requirements in terms of performance, including safety and environmental
performance, rather than design or descriptive characteristics.
3
4. Where a Party accepts supplier’s declaration of conformity as a positive
assurance of conformity, it shall endeavour to do so without requiring the submission
of test results.
5. If a Party requires test reports (alone, as the basis of, or in conjunction with
other assurances of conformity) as positive assurance that a product conforms with its
relevant standard or technical regulations, it shall endeavour to accept test reports in
form of the International Electrotechnical Commission System for Conformity
Testing and Certification of Electrical Equipment (IECEE CB Scheme) Test Reports
without requiring any further testing.
6. Where a Party requires third party certification for product, this Party shall
endeavour to accept a valid CB Test Certificate under the CB Scheme of the
Worldwide System for Conformity Testing and Certification of Electrotechnical
Equipment and Components (IECEE) as sufficient positive assurance of conformity
without requiring any further conformity assessment or administrative procedures or
approvals.
7. For greater certainty, this paragraph is without prejudice to the Parties applying
requirements not related to the products in question, such as zoning laws or building
codes.
ARTICLE 6:
Exceptions
1. The provisions of this Annex are subject to Articles [general exception clauses,
applicable horizontally or specifically to goods, services, procurement or - if included
- investment].
2. For greater certainty, subject to the requirement that such measures are not
applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable
discrimination between the Parties' products, service suppliers or investors under like
circumstances, or a disguised restriction on trade and investment between the Parties,
nothing in this Annex shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by any
of the Parties of measures necessary for the safe operation of the energy networks
concerned, or the safety of energy supply.
ARTICLE 7:
IMPLEMENTATION AND COOPERATION
1. In the [Committee] established pursuant to Article […], the Parties shall
cooperate and exchange information on any issues relevant for the implementation of
4
this Annex, and may in that [committee] decide to adopt appropriate implementing
measures to this effect.
2. Cooperation may include
(a) exchanging information, regulatory experiences and best practices in areas
such as:
- the design and non-discriminatory implementation of measures
promoting the uptake of energy from renewable sources;
- technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment
procedures, such as those relating to grid code requirements;
(b) promoting cooperation, also in relevant regional fora, with respect to their
domestic or regional technical regulations, regulatory concepts, standards,
requirements and conformity assessment procedures with international
standards.
