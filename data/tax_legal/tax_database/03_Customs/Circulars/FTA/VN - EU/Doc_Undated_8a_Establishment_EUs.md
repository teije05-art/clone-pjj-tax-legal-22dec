6
Public utilities exist in sectors such as related scientific and technical consulting services, R&D services on social sciences and humanities, technical testing and analysis
services, environmental services, health services, transport services and services auxiliary to all modes of transport. Exclusive rights on such services are often granted to
private operators, for instance operators with concessions from public authorities, subject to specific service obligations. Given that public utilities often also exist at the sub-

24 A juridical person is controlled by other natural or juridical person(s) if the latter has/have the power to name a majority of its directors or otherwise legally direct its
actions. In particular, ownership of more than 50 percent of the equity interests in a juridical person shall be deemed to constitute control.
25 Includes legal advisory services, legal representational services, legal arbitration and conciliation/mediation services, and legal documentation and certification services.
Provision of legal services is only authorised in respect of public international law, EU law and the law of any jurisdiction where the service supplier or its personnel is
qualified to practice as a lawyer, and, like the provision of other services, is subject to licensing requirements and procedures applicable in the Member States of the
European Union. For lawyers providing legal services in respect of public international law and foreign law, these licensing requirements and procedures may take, inter
alia, the form of compliance with local codes of ethics, use of home title (unless recognition with the host title has been obtained), insurance requirements, simple
registration with the host country Bar or a simplified admission to the host country Bar through an aptitude test and a legal or professional domicile in the host country.
Legal services in respect of EU law shall in principle be carried out by or through a fully qualified lawyer admitted to the Bar in a Member State of the European Union
acting personally, and legal services in respect of the law of a Member State of the European Union shall in principle be carried out by or through a fully qualified lawyer
admitted to the Bar in that Member State acting personally. Full admission to the Bar in the relevant Member State of the European Union might therefore be necessary
for representation before courts and other competent authorities in the EU Party since it involves practice of EU and national procedural law. However, in some Member
States, foreign lawyers not fully admitted to the Bar are allowed to represent in civil proceedings a party being a national of or belonging to the State in which the lawyer
is entitled to practice.

admitted to the Bar in France. In a law firm providing services in respect of French or EU law, at least 75% of the partners holding 75%
of the shares shall be lawyers fully admitted to the Bar in France.
In HR: Representation of parties before courts can be practised only by the members of the Bar Council of Croatia (Croatian title
“odvjetnici”). Citizenship requirement for membership in the Bar Council.
In HU: Commercial presence should take the form of partnership with a Hungarian barrister (ügyvéd) or a barrister’s office (ügyvédi
iroda), or a representative office.
In LT: Full admission to the Bar, required for the practice of domestic (EU and Member State) law, is subject to a nationality
condition.
In PL: While other types of legal form are available for EU lawyers, foreign lawyers only have access to the legal forms of general
partnership, limited joint-stock partnership and limited partnership.
