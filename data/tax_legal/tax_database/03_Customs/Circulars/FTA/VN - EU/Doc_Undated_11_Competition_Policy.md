Competition Policy Chapter
SECTION I: ANTICOMPETITIVE CONDUCTS
ARTICLE 1
Principles
The Parties recognise the importance of undistorted competition in their trade and
investment relations. The Parties acknowledge that anti-competitive conducts have the
potential to distort the proper functioning of markets and undermine the benefits of
trade liberalisation.
ARTICLE 2
Legislative framework
(1) The Parties shall adopt or maintain comprehensive competition legislation that
proscribes anticompetitive conduct, with the objective of promoting economic
efficiency and consumer welfare, and shall take appropriate action with respect to such
conduct.
(2) The respective competition laws shall effectively address in their respective territories:
a) agreements between enterprises, decisions by associations of enterprises and
concerted practices which have as their object or effect the prevention,
restriction or distortion of competition,
b) abuses by one or more enterprises of a dominant position, and
c) concentrations between enterprises which would significantly impede effective
competition.
ARTICLE 3
Implementation
(1) The Parties shall maintain their autonomy in developing and enforcing their
competition law.
(2) The Parties shall maintain authorities responsible for, appropriately equipped for and
with the powers necessary for the full application and the effective enforcement of their
competition law.
(3) All enterprises, private or public, shall be subject to the competition law referred to
above in Article 2.
1
(4) The Parties will apply their respective competition law in a transparent and non-
discriminatory manner, including to private and public enterprises, respecting the
principles of procedural fairness and rights of defense of the enterprises.
(5) The application of the competition law should not obstruct the performance, in law or
in fact, of the particular tasks of public interest assigned to the enterprises in question.
Exemptions from the competition law of a Party should be limited to tasks of public
interest, proportionate to the desired public policy objective and transparent.
ARTICLE 4
Dispute settlement
No Party shall have recourse to dispute settlement under this Agreement for any matter
arising under this Section.

SECTION II: SUBSIDIES
Article x.1
Principles
(1) The Parties agree that subsidies can be granted by a Party when they are necessary to
achieve a public policy objective. The Parties acknowledge, however, that certain
subsidies have the potential to distort the proper functioning of markets and undermine
the benefits of trade liberalisation. In principle, subsidies granted to enterprises
providing goods or services should not be granted by a Party when they negatively
affect, or are likely to affect, competition and trade.
(2) An illustrative list of public policy objectives for which subsidies could be granted by a
Party, subject to the conditions set out in this Section, includes the following:
(a) making good the damage caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences;
(b) promoting the economic development of areas where the standard of living is
abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment;
(c) remedying a serious disturbance in the economy of one of the Parties;
(d) facilitating the development of certain economic activities or of certain economic
areas, including but not limited to, subsidies for clearly defined research,
development and innovation purposes, subsidies for training or for the creation of
employment, subsidies for environmental purposes, subsidies in favour of small
and medium-sized enterprises as defined in the Parties’ respective legislations;
and
(e) promoting culture and heritage conservation.
(3) Each Party shall ensure that enterprises use the specific subsidies provided by a Party
only for the policy objective for which the specific subsidies have been granted1.
Article x.2
Definition and scope
(1) For the purposes of this Agreement, a subsidy is a measure which fulfils mutatis
mutandis the conditions set out in Article 1.1 of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and
1 For greater certainty, when a Party has set up the relevant legislative frameworks and administrative
procedures to this effect, the obligation is considered to be fulfilled.
3
Countervailing Measures (ASCM) irrespective whether it is granted to an enterprise
manufacturing goods or supplying services2.
(2) A subsidy shall be subject to this Section only if this subsidy is determined to be
specific in accordance with the provisions of and within the meaning of Article 2 of the
ASCM. Subsidies to individual consumers or general measures, including such
subsidies or measures to achieve social policy objectives, are not considered as specific
in the meaning of this Section.
(3) Specific subsidies to all enterprises, including public and private enterprises, shall be
subject to this Section.
(4) The application of the rules in this Section must not obstruct the performance, in law or
in fact, of the particular tasks of public interest, including public service obligations,
assigned to the enterprises in question. Exemptions should be limited to tasks of public
interest, proportionate to the public policy objectives assigned to them and transparent.
(5) This Section shall not apply to non-economic activities.
(6) Article x.6, paragraph 1 (specific subsidies subject to conditions) shall not apply to
fisheries subsidies and subsidies related to trade in goods covered by Annex 1 of the
WTO Agreement on Agriculture.
(7) This Section applies only to specific subsidies of which the amount per beneficiary
over a period of 3 years is above 300.000 Special Drawing Rights3.
(8) With regard to subsidies to services, Article x.4 (transparency) and Article x.6 (specific
subsidies subject to conditions) apply only to the following services sectors:
telecommunications, banking, insurance, transport including maritime, energy,
computer services, architecture and engineering, and construction and environmental
services, subject to the reservations taken in Chapter on Cross border Supply of
services or the Chapter on Investment of this Agreement.
(9) This Section shall not apply to sectors or sub-sectors which the Parties have not listed
under the Chapter on Cross border Supply of services or the Chapter on Investment of
this Agreement.
(10) Article x.6 shall not apply to subsidies formally agreed or granted before or within 5
years after the entry into force of this Agreement.
2 This Article does not prejudice the Parties' positions and the possible outcome of future discussions in
the WTO on subsidies to services. Depending on the progress of those discussions at the WTO level, the
Parties may adopt a decision by a relevant committee to update this Agreement in this respect.
3 For greater certainty, the notification obligation does not require the notifying Party to provide the
name of the beneficiary of the subsidy.
4
Article x.3
Relationship with the WTO
The provisions in this Section shall be applied without prejudice to the rights and obligations
of each Party under Article VI of GATT 1994, the SCM Agreement and the WTO
Agreement on Agriculture.
Article x.4
Transparency
(1) Each Party shall ensure transparency in the area of specific subsidies. To this end, each
Party shall notify every four years the legal basis, form, amount or budget and where
possible the recipient of the specific subsidy.
(2) Such notification is deemed to have been fulfilled if the relevant information is made
available by the Parties or on their behalf on a publicly accessible website, as from 31
December of the subsequent calendar year. The first notification shall be made
available no later than 4 years after the entry into force of this agreement.
Article x.5
Consultations
(1) If a Party considers that a specific subsidy granted by the other Party, which is not
covered by Article x.6 of this Section, is negatively affecting, or may negatively affect
the first Party's trade or investment interests, the first Party may express its concern in
written form to the other Party and request consultations on the matter. The requested
Party shall accord sympathetic consideration to such a request. The consultation should
in particular aim at specifying whether the specific subsidy was only granted to achieve
a public policy objective, the amount of the subsidy in question is limited to the
minimum needed to achieve this objective, the subsidy has an incentive effect and the
negative effect on trade and investment of the requesting Party is limited.
(2) In order to facilitate the consultation, the requested Party shall provide information on
the specific subsidy in question within no more than 90 days from the date of reception
of the request. If the requesting Party, after receiving information on the subsidy in
question, considers that the subsidy concerned by the consultations negatively affects
or may negatively affect in a disproportionate manner the requesting Party's trade or
investment interests, the requested Party will use its best endeavours to eliminate or
minimise the negative effects on the requesting Party's trade and investment interests
caused by the subsidy in question.
Article x.6
Specific subsidies subject to conditions
(1) The Parties shall apply conditions to the following specific subsidies:
5
(a) A legal arrangement whereby a government or any public body is responsible to
cover debts or liabilities of certain enterprises is allowed provided that the
coverage of the debts and liabilities is limited as regards the amount of those
debts and liabilities or the duration of such responsibility;
(b) Support to insolvent or ailing enterprises in various forms (such as loans and
guarantees, cash grants, capital injections, provision of assets below market
prices, tax exemptions) with a duration above 1 year is allowed provided that a
credible restructuring plan has been prepared which is based on realistic
assumptions with a view to ensuring the return of the enterprise within a
reasonable time to long-term viability and with the enterprise contributing itself
to the costs of restructuring.4
(2) Subparagraphs (a) and (b) above do not apply to specific subsidies of which the
subsidising Party upon a written request of the other Party has demonstrated that the
subsidy in question does not affect trade and investment of the other Party nor will be
likely to do so.
(3) Subparagraphs (a) and (b) above do not apply to specific subsidies that are granted to
remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of one of the Parties. A disturbance in the
economy of a Party is considered serious if it is exceptional, temporary and significant
and affects the Member States or the whole economy of a Party rather than a specific
region or economic sector of a Party or its Member State.
Article x.7
Dispute settlement
Article x.5 (consultations) of this Section shall not be subject to the dispute settlement
provisions of this Agreement.
Article x.8
Review clause
The Parties shall review this Section no later than five years after the entry into force of this
Agreement and at regular intervals thereafter. The Parties shall consult each other on the
need to modify this Section in light of the experience gained and the development of any
corresponding rules in the WTO. The Parties will, in particular, review the inclusion of
additional services sectors under the scope of this Section under Article x.2 paragraph 8.
4
This does not prevent the Parties from providing temporary liquidity support in the form of loan
guarantees or loans limited to the amount needed to keep the enterprise in business for the time necessary to
work out a restructuring or liquidation plan.
