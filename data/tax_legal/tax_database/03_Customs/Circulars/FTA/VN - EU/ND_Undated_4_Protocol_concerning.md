DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT OF “ORIGINATING PRODUCTS”
Article 2
General requirements
For the purpose of implementing this Agreement, the following products shall be considered
as originating in a Party:
(a) products wholly obtained in a Party within the meaning of Article 4;
(b) products obtained in a Party incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained
there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in
the Party concerned within the meaning of Article 5.
Article 3
Cumulation of origin
1. Notwithstanding Article 2, products shall be considered as originating in the exporting
Party if such products are obtained there by incorporating materials originating in the other
Party, provided that the working or processing carried out in the exporting Party goes beyond
the operations referred to in Article 6.
2. Materials listed in Annex III originating in an ASEAN country which is applying with
the Union a preferential agreement in accordance with Article XXIV of the GATT 1994, shall
be considered as materials originating in Vietnam when further processed or incorporated into
one of the products listed in Annex IV.
3. For the purposes of paragraph 2, the origin of the materials shall be determined
according to the rules of origin applicable in the framework of the Union's preferential
agreements with those countries.
4. For the purposes of paragraph 2, the originating status of materials exported from one
of the ASEAN countries to Vietnam to be used in further working or processing shall
4
be established by a proof of origin as if these materials were exported directly to the
Union.
5. The cumulation provided for in paragraphs 2 to 4 shall only apply provided that:
(a) the ASEAN countries involved in the acquisition of the originating status have
undertaken to:
(i) comply or ensure compliance with this Protocol; and
(ii) provide the administrative cooperation necessary to
ensure the correct implementation of this Protocol both
with regard to the Union and among themselves;
(b) the undertakings referred to in subparagraph (a) have been notified to the
Union;
(c) the tariff duty applicable by the Union to the products in Annex IV obtained in
Vietnam by use of such cumulation is higher or the same than the duty

involved in the cumulation.
6. Proofs of origin issued by application of paragraph 2 shall bear the following entry:
“Application of Article 3(2) of the Protocol of the EU-Vietnam FTA”.
7. Fabrics originating in the Republic of Korea shall be considered as originating in

8. For the purposes of paragraph 7, the origin of the fabrics shall be determined
according to the rules of origin applicable in the framework of the Union's preferential
agreement with the Republic of Korea except for the rules set out in Annex II(a) to the
Protocol concerning the definition of originating products and methods of
administrative cooperation.
9. For the purposes of paragraphs 7, the originating status of the fabrics exported from
the Republic of Korea to Vietnam to be used in further working or processing shall be
established by a proof of origin as if these fabrics were exported directly from the
Republic of Korea to the Union.
10. The cumulation provided for in paragraphs 7 to 9 shall only apply provided that:

Annex V obtained there, provided that they have undergone working or processing in
a Party which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6.
13. The Committee on Customs shall take a decision on the request for cumulation and the
modalities for such cumulation referred to in paragraph 12 taking into account the

or
(ii) they are owned by companies
- which have their head office and their main place of business in a Member State
of the Union or Vietnam, and
- which are at least 50% owned by a Member State of the Union or by Vietnam, by
public entities or nationals of one of those Parties.
Article 5
Sufficiently worked or processed products
1. For the purposes of Article 2(b), products which are not wholly obtained are considered to
be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in Annex II are
fulfilled.
2. The conditions referred to above indicate, for all products covered by the Agreement, the
working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in
manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials.
It follows that if a product which has acquired originating status, by fulfilling the conditions
set out in the list is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to
the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the
non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.
3. By way of derogation from paragraph 1 and subject to paragraphs 4 and 5 of this
Article, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list, in
Annex II are not to be used in the manufacture of a given product may nevertheless be used,
provided that their total value or net weight assessed for the product does not exceed:
(a) 10% of the weight of the product or ex work price for products falling within
Chapters 2 and 4 to 24 of the Harmonized System, other than processed fishery
products of Chapter 16;
(b) 10% of the ex-works price of the product for other products, except for products
falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonized System, for which the tolerances
mentioned in Notes 6 and 7 of Annex I, shall apply.
4. Paragraph 3 shall not allow exceeding any of the percentages for the maximum value
or weight of non-originating materials as specified in the rules laid down in the list in Annex
II.
5. Paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not apply to products wholly obtained in a Party within the
meaning of Article 4. However, without prejudice to Article 6 and 7(2), the tolerance
provided for in those paragraphs shall nevertheless apply to the sum of all the materials which
are used in the manufacture of a product and for which the rule laid down in the list in Annex
II for that product requires that such materials be wholly obtained.
7
Article 6

special skills nor machines, apparatus or tools especially produced or installed for those
operations are required for their performance.
3. All operations carried out either in the Union or in Vietnam on a given product shall
be considered together when determining whether the working or processing undergone by
that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1.
8
Article 7
Unit of qualification
1. The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Protocol shall be
the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification
using the nomenclature of the Harmonized System.
2. When a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the
same subheading of the Harmonized System, each individual item shall be taken account
when applying the provisions of this Protocol.
Where, under General Rule 5 of the Harmonized System, packaging is included with the
product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin.
Article 8
Accessories, spare parts and tools
Accessories, spare parts, tools and instructional or other information materials dispatched with
a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment
and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as
one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question.
Article 9
Sets
Sets, as defined in General Rule 3 of the Harmonized System, shall be regarded as originating
when all component products are originating products. When a set is composed of originating
and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that
the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 per cent of the ex-works price of
the set.
Article 10
Neutral elements
In order to determine whether a product originates, it shall not be necessary to determine the
origin of the following which might be used in its manufacture:
(a) energy and fuel;
(b) plant and equipment, including goods to be used for their maintenance;
(c) machines and tools and dies and moulds; spare parts and materials used in the
maintenance of equipment and buildings; lubricants, greases, compounding materials and
other materials used in production or used to operate equipment and buildings; gloves,
glasses, footwear, clothing, safety equipment and supplies; equipment, devices and
supplies used for testing or inspecting the good; catalyst and solvent;
9
(d) other goods which do not enter and which are not intended to enter into the final
composition of the product.
Article 11
Accounting segregation
1. If originating and non-originating fungible materials are used in the working or
processing of a product, competent authorities may, at the written request of economic
operators, authorise the management of materials using the accounting segregation method
without keeping the materials in separate stocks.
2. Competent governmental authorities may make the granting of authorisation referred
to in paragraph 1 subject to any conditions they deem appropriate.
3. The authorisation shall be granted only if by use of the accounting segregation method
it can be ensured that, at any time, the number of products obtained which could be
considered as originating in the Union or in Vietnam is the same as the number that would
have been obtained by using a method of physical segregation of the stocks.
4. If authorised, the accounting segregation method and its application shall be recorded
on the basis of the general accounting principles applicable in the Union or in Vietnam,
depending on where the product is manufactured.
5. A manufacturer using the accounting segregation method shall make out or apply for
origin declarations for the quantity of products which may be considered as originating in the
exporting Party. At the request of the customs authorities or competent governmental
authorities of the exporting Party, the beneficiary shall provide a statement of how the
quantities have been managed.
6. Competent authorities shall monitor the use made of the authorisation referred to in
paragraph 3 and may withdraw it if the manufacturer makes improper use of it or fails to fulfil
any of the other conditions laid down in this protocol.

and
(b) they have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve them in good
condition while in that non-Party or while being exported.
Article 13
Non alteration
1. The products declared for home use in a Party shall be the same products as exported
from the other Party in which they are considered to originate. They shall not have been
altered, transformed in any way or subjected to operations other than operations to preserve
them in good condition or other than adding or affixing marks, labels, seals or any other
documentation to ensure compliance with specific domestic requirements of the importing
Party carried out under customs supervision in the country(ies) of transit or splitting prior to
being declared for home use.
2. Storage of products or consignments may take place provided they remain under
customs supervision in the country(ies) of transit.
3. Without prejudice to provisions of Title IV, the splitting of consignments may take
place where carried out by the exporter or under his responsibility, provided they remain
under customs supervision in the country(ies) of splitting.

compliance, which may be given by any means, including:
i) contractual transport documents such as bills of lading;
ii) factual or concrete evidence based on marking or numbering of packages;

after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purpose
of applying preferential treatment, where the importer failed to submit these documents by the
final date due to force majeure or other valid reasons beyond his control.
15
3. In other cases of belated presentation, the customs authorities of the importing Party may
accept the proofs of origin where the products have been imported before the said final date.
Article 22
Submission of proof of origin
For the purpose of claiming preferential tariff treatment, proofs of origin shall be submitted to
the customs authorities of the importing Party in accordance with the procedures applicable in
that Party. The said authorities may require a translation of the proof of origin if it is not
issued in English.
Article 23
Importation by instalments
Where, at the request of the importer and on the conditions laid down by the customs
authorities of the importing Party, dismantled or non-assembled products within the meaning
of General Rule 2(a) of the Harmonized System falling within Sections XVI and XVII or
headings 7308 and 9406 of the Harmonized System are imported by instalments, a single
proof of origin for such products shall be submitted to the customs authorities upon
importation of the first instalment.
Article 24
Exemptions from proof of origin
1. Products sent as small packages from private persons to private persons or forming part
of travellers' personal luggage shall be admitted as originating products without requiring the
submission of a proof of origin, provided that such products are not imported by way of trade
and have been declared as meeting the requirements of this Protocol and where there is no
doubt as to the veracity of such a declaration. In the case of products sent by post, this
declaration can be made on the customs declaration CN22/CN23 or on a sheet of paper
annexed to that document.
2. Imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the
recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it
is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is in view.
3. Furthermore, the total value of these products shall not exceed:
(a) when entering the Union, EUR 500 in the case of small packages or EUR 1 200 in the case
of products forming part of travellers' personal luggage;
(b) when entering Vietnam, 200 US dollars both in the case of small packages and in the case
of products forming part of travellers' personal luggage.
Article 25

4. Each Party shall permit, in accordance with that Party’s laws and regulations, exporters
in its territory to maintain documentation or records in any medium, provided that the
documentation or records can be retrieved and printed.
Article 27
Discrepancies and formal errors
1. The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the proof of origin
and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying
out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the proof of origin
null and void if it is duly established that this document does correspond to the products
submitted.
2. Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a proof of origin should not cause this
document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the
correctness of the statements made in this document.
3. For multiple goods declared under the same proof of origin, a problem encountered with
one of the goods listed shall not affect or delay the granting of preferential tariff treatment and
customs clearance of the remaining goods listed in the proof of origin.
Article 28
Amounts expressed in euro
1. For the application of the provisions of Article 15(1)(b)(ii) and Article 24(3)(a) in cases
where products are invoiced in a currency other than euro, amounts in the national currencies
of the Member States of the Union or of Vietnam equivalent to the amounts expressed in euro
shall be fixed annually by each of the countries concerned.
17
2. A consignment shall benefit from the provisions of Article 15(1)(b)(ii) or Article 24(3)(a)
by reference to the currency in which the invoice is drawn up, according to the amount fixed
by the Party concerned.
3. The amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that
currency of the amounts expressed in euro as at the first working day of October. The
amounts shall be communicated to the European Commission by 15 October and shall apply
from 1 January the following year. The European Commission shall notify all countries
concerned of the relevant amounts.
4. A Party may round up or down the amount resulting from the conversion into its national
currency of an amount expressed in euro. The rounded-off amount may not differ from the
amount resulting from the conversion by more than 5 per cent. A Party may retain unchanged
its national currency equivalent of an amount expressed in euro if, at the time of the annual
adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that amount, prior to any rounding-
off, results in an increase of less than 15 per cent in the national currency equivalent. The
national currency equivalent may be retained unchanged if the conversion would result in a
decrease in that equivalent value.
5. The amounts expressed in euro shall be reviewed by the [Customs Committee] at the
request of the Union or of Vietnam. When carrying out this review, the [Customs Committee]
shall consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms.
For this purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in euro.

18
documents and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the proof of
origin is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for verification.
3. The verification shall be carried out by the competent authorities of the exporting Party.
For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any
inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate.
4. If the competent authorities of the importing Party decide to suspend the granting of
preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification,
release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary measures
judged necessary. Any suspension of preferential treatment shall be reinstated as soon as
possible after the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other
requirements of this Protocol has been ascertained by the competent authorities of the
importing Party.
5. The competent authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results of
this verification as soon as possible. These results must indicate clearly whether the
documents are authentic and whether the products concerned can be considered as products
originating in the Parties and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.

21
ANNEX I
INTRODUCTORY NOTES TO THE LIST IN ANNEX II
Note 1 – General introduction
The list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently
worked or processed within the meaning of Article 5 of this Protocol. There are four different
types of rule, which vary according to the product:
(a) through working or processing a maximum content of non-originating materials is not
exceeded;
(b) through working or processing the 4-digit Harmonized System heading or 6-digit
Harmonized System sub-heading of the manufactured products becomes different from
the 4-digit Harmonized System heading or 6-digit sub-heading respectively of the
materials used. However, in the case set out in point 3.3. 2nd paragraph, the 4-digit
Harmonized System heading or 6-digit Harmonized System sub-heading of the
manufactured products may be the same as the 4-digit Harmonized System heading or
6-digit sub-heading respectively of the materials used;
(c) a specific working and processing operation is carried out;
(d) working or processing is carried out on certain wholly obtained materials.
Note 2 – The structure of the list
2.1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives
the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System and the second
column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter.
For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3. Where, in
some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an "ex", this signifies that the
rules in column 3 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.
2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number
is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general
terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 apply to all products which, under the
Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings
grouped together in column 1.
2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a
heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the
adjacent rules in column 3.
2.4. Where two alternative rules are set out in column 3, separated by "or", it is at the
choice of the exporter which one to use.
22
Note 3 – Examples of how to apply the rules
3.1. Article 5 of this Protocol, concerning products having acquired originating status
which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply, regardless of whether
this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in
another factory in a Party.
3.2. Pursuant to Article 6, the working or processing carried out must go beyond the list of
operations mentioned in that Article. If it does not, the goods shall not qualify for the
granting of the benefit of preferential tariff treatment, even if the conditions set out in
the list below are met.
Subject to the provision referred to in the first sub-paragraph, the rules in the list
represent the minimum amount of working or processing required. The carrying-out of
more working or processing also confers originating status, without prejudice to
Article 6 (see point 3.2). Conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing
cannot confer originating status.
3.3. Where a rule uses the expression “Manufacture from materials of any heading, except
that of the product” all non-originating materials classified in headings other than that
of the product may be used (CTH).
Where a rule uses the expression "Manufacture from materials of any heading", then
materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the
product) may be used.
3.4. Where a rule uses the expression “Manufacture in which the value of all the materials
used does not exceed x% of the ex-works price of the product” then the value of all
non-originating material is to be considered and the percentage for the maximum value
of non-originating materials may not be exceeded through the use of Article 5(3)
[tolerance].
3.5 If a rule provides that a specific non-originating material may be used, the use of
materials which still are in an earlier stage of the manufacturing process of that
specific material is allowed, and the use of materials resulting from further processing
of that specific non-originating material is not.
If a rule provides that a specific non-originating material may not be used, the use of
materials which still are in an earlier stage of the manufacturing process of that
specific non-originating material is allowed, and the use of materials resulting from
further processing of that specific non-originating material is not.
Example: when the list-rule for Chapter 19 requires that “non-originating materials of
headings 1101 to 1108 cannot exceed 20% weight”, the use of non-originating cereals
of Chapter 10 (materials at an earlier stage in the manufacturing process of goods of
1101 to 1108) is not limited by the 20% weight.
3.6. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than
one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require
that all have to be used.
3.7. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular
material, the condition does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of
their inherent nature, cannot satisfy this requirement.
23
Example: Flat-rolled products of iron and non-alloy steel, of a width of 600 mm or
more, which have been painted, varnished or coated with plastics are classified in the
HS under 7210 70. The PSR for 7210 is “Manufacture from ingots or other primary
forms or semi-finished materials of heading 7206 and 7207. This rule does not prevent
the use of non-originating paint and varnish (heading 3208) or plastics (chapter 39).
Note 4 – General provisions concerning certain agricultural goods
4.1. Agricultural goods falling within Chapters 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and heading 2401 which
are grown or harvested in the territory of a Party shall be treated as originating in the
territory of that Party, even if grown from seeds, bulbs, rootstock, cuttings, grafts,
shoots, buds, or other live parts of plants imported from a non-Party.
4.2 Whenever the rules for products in Chapters 1-24 incorporate some limitations in
weight, it should be noted that in accordance with Article 5(2) of the Protocol, these
limitations in weight only apply to non-originating materials. Consequently
originating materials are not to be taken into account for the calculation of the
limitations in weight. In addition, these limitations are expressed in different manners.
In particular:
 When the rule uses the expression “the weight of the materials of
Chapters/headings....” it means that the weight of each material mentioned should
be added up and that the total weight should not exceed the maximum %
Example: The rule for Chapter 19 provides that the weight of the materials of
Chapters 2, 3 and 16 used does not exceed 20% of the weight of the final product.
In case the weight of the final product contains 12% of materials of Chapter 3 and
10% of materials of Chapter 16, the product does not meet the origin conferring
rule of Chapter 19 as the combined weight exceeds 20%.
 When the rule uses the expression “the individual weight of the materials of
Chapters/headings” it means that the weight of each material mentioned should not
exceed the maximum %. The combined weight of the materials added together has
no relevance.
Example: The rule for Chapter 22 provides that the individual weight of sugar and
of the materials of Chapter 4 does not exceed 20% of the weight of the final
product. In case the weight of the final product contains 15% of sugar as well as
10% of materials of Chapter 4, the origin conferring rule of Chapter 22 is complied
with. Each individual material is less than 20%. On the contrary, in case the weight
of the final product contains 25% of sugar as well as 10% of materials of Chapter
4, the origin conferring rule is not met.
 When the rule uses the expression “the total combined weight of sugar and of the
materials of Chapter 4 does not exceed a % in weight of the final product” it means
that both the weight of the sugar and the materials of Chapter 4 must meet
individually their weight limitation as well as their combined weights added up
must meet the combined weight restriction. A combined weight limitation
expresses a further restriction to the individual weight limitations.
Example: The rule for heading 1704 provides that the combined weight of sugar
and of the materials of Chapter 4 does not exceed 50% of the weight of the final
product. The individual weight limitations for materials of Chapter 4 are 20% and
for sugar 40%. In case the weight of the final product contains 35% of sugar as
24
well as 15% of materials of Chapter 4, both the individual weight limitations and
the combined weight limitations of the origin conferring rule of heading 1704 are
complied with. On the contrary, in case the weight of the final product contains
35% of sugar as well as 20% of materials of Chapter 4, the combined weight
represents 55%. In that case the individual weight limitations are respected but the
combined weight limitation is exceeded and therefore the origin conferring rule of
heading 1704 is not complied with.
Note 5 - Terminology used in respect of certain textile products
5.1. The term "natural fibres" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or
synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including
waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded,
combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.
5.2. The term "natural fibres" includes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of headings 5002
and 5003, as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101
to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of
headings 5301 to 5305.
5.3. The terms "textile pulp", "chemical materials" and "paper-making materials" are used
in the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be
used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.
5.4. The term "man-made staple fibres" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial
filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.
Note 6 - Tolerances applicable to products made of a mixture of textile materials
6.1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set
out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the
manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the
total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 6.3 and 6.4).
6.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 6.1 may be applied only to mixed products
which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.
The following are the basic textile materials:
- silk;
- wool;
- coarse animal hair;
- fine animal hair;
- horsehair;
- cotton;
- paper-making materials and paper;
25
- flax;
- true hemp;
- jute and other textile bast fibres;
- sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave;
- coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres;
- synthetic man-made filaments;
- artificial man-made filaments;
- current-conducting filaments;
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene;
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester;
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide;
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile;
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide;
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene;
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide);
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride);
- other synthetic man-made staple fibres;
- artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose;
- other artificial man-made staple fibres;
- yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether,
whether or not gimped;
- yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether
or not gimped;
products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of
aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium
powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or
coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film;
- other products of heading 5605;
- glass fibres;
26
- metal fibres.
Example:
A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple
fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple
fibres which do not satisfy the origin rules may be used, provided that their total
weight does not exceed 10% of the weight of the yarn.
Example:
A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and
synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic
yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules, or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the
origin rules, or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight
does not exceed 10% of the weight of the fabric.
Example:
Tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and
cotton fabric of heading 5210, is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a
mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton
yarns used are themselves mixtures.
Example:
If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205
and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate
basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.
6.3. In the case of products incorporating "yarn made of polyurethane segmented with
flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped", this tolerance is 20 % in
respect of this yarn.
6.4. In the case of products incorporating "strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of
a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not
exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between
two layers of plastic film", this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.
Note 7 - Other tolerances applicable to certain textile products
7.1. Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials which do not satisfy
the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be
used, provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and
that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.
7.2. Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50
to 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they
contain textiles.
27
Example:
If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn
must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because
buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not
prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain
textiles.
7.3. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of non-originating materials which are not
classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the
value of the non-originating materials incorporated.
Note 8 - Definition of specific processes and simple operations carried out in respect of
certain products of Chapter 27
8.1. For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, the "specific processes" are the
following:
(a) vacuum-distillation;
(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;

activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;
(g) polymerisation;
(h) alkylation;
(i) isomerisation.
8.2. For the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the "specific processes" are the
following:
(a) vacuum-distillation;
(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;
(c) cracking;
(d) reforming;
(e) extraction by means of selective solvents;
28
(f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with
concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with

ANNEX VIII
EXPLANATORY NOTES
1. For the purposes of Article 1(p), the “exporter” is not necessarily the person (the seller) that
issues the sales invoice for the consignment (third party invoicing). The seller can be located
in the territory of a non-Party to the agreement.
2. For the purposes of Article 4(1)(b) “plants and vegetable products” includes notably live
trees, flowers, fruits, vegetables, seaweeds and fungi.
3. For the purposes of Article 11 general accounting principles means the recognised
consensus or substantial authoritative support in the territory of a Party, with respect to the
recording of revenues, expenses, costs, assets and liabilities; the disclosure of information;
and the preparation of financial statements. These standards may encompass broad guidelines
of general application as well as detailed standards, practices and procedures.
4. For the purpose of Article 13(4) the terms "In case of doubt" means that the importing
Party has the discretion of determining the cases for which the declarant is requested to
provide evidence of compliance with Article 13 but that it cannot routinely require the
submission of that evidence.
5. For the purposes of Article 17(1) “in writing” includes an application being made by
electronic means.
6. For the purpose of Article 17(3) the terms “to submit at any time, at the request of the

targeted requests for the submission of the supporting documents.

accompanying: delivery note, a pro-forma invoice or a packing list. A transport document,
such as a Bill of Lading or the Airway Bill, cannot be considered as another commercial
document. An origin declaration on a separate form is not permitted. The origin declaration
may be submitted on a separate sheet of the commercial document when the sheet is an
obvious part of this document.
8. As regards the application of Article 32, the customs authorities of the exporting country
endeavour to inform the importing authorities about the receipt of the verification request.
They may do so in any form, including electronic. They also endeavour to inform the
requesting authorities in case they need more time than the period of ten months foreseen to
carry out verification and provide a reply.
9. As regards the application of Article 32(6), the requesting competent authorities shall check
