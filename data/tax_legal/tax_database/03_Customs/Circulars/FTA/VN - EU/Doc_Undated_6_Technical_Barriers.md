CHAPTER …
TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE
ARTICLE 1: REAFFIRMATION OF THE WTO AGREEMENT ON TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE.
1. The Parties reaffirm their existing rights and obligations with respect to each other under
the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, (hereinafter referred to as the “TBT
Agreement”) which is incorporated into and made part of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 2: OBJECTIVES.
1. The objectives of this Chapter are to facilitate and increase bilateral trade in goods by
preventing, identifying and eliminating unnecessary obstacles to trade within the scope of the
TBT Agreement, and enhancing cooperation between the Parties.
2. The Parties undertake to establish and enhance technical capabilities and institutional
infrastructure on matters concerning TBT.
ARTICLE 3: SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS.
1. This Chapter applies to the preparation, adoption and application of standards,
technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures as defined in the TBT
Agreement, that may affect trade in goods between the Parties, except:
(a) purchasing specifications prepared by governmental bodies for production or
consumption requirements of such bodies; or
(b) sanitary and phytosanitary measures as defined in Annex A of the Agreement
on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (hereinafter
referred to as the “SPS Agreement”).
2. In accordance with this Chapter and the TBT Agreement, each Party has the right to
prepare, adopt and apply standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment
procedures.
3. For the purposes of this Chapter, the definitions of Annex 1 to the TBT Agreement
shall apply.
ARTICLE 4: TECHNICAL REGULATIONS.
1. The Parties agree to make best use of good regulatory practices, as provided for in the
TBT Agreement and in this Chapter. In particular, the Parties agree:
(a) to assess the available regulatory and non-regulatory alternatives to the proposed
technical regulation that may fulfil the Party's legitimate objective, in accordance
with Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement; and to endeavour to assess, inter alia, the
impact of the envisaged technical regulation in the form of a regulatory impact
assessment as recommended by the TBT Committee;
1
(b) to use relevant international standards, such as those developed by ISO, IEC, ITU,
the Codex Alimentarius Commission, as a basis for their technical regulations,
except when such international standards would be an ineffective or inappropriate
means for the fulfilment of the legitimate objectives pursued; and where
international standards have not been used as a basis, on request from the other
Party, to identify any substantial deviation from the relevant international standard
and to explain the reasons why such standards have been judged inappropriate or
ineffective for the aim pursued;
(c) without prejudice to Article 2.3. of the TBT Agreement, to review technical
regulations with a view to increasing their convergence with relevant international
standards. In undertaking this review, the Parties shall, inter alia, take into account
any new development in the relevant international standards and whether the
circumstances that have given rise to divergences from any relevant international
standard continue to exist;
(d) to specify technical regulations based on product performance requirements, rather
than design or descriptive characteristics.
2. In accordance with Article 2.7 of the TBT Agreement, the Parties shall give positive
consideration to accepting as equivalent, technical regulations of another Party, even if these
regulations differ from its own, provided it is satisfied that these regulations adequately fulfil
the objectives of its own regulations.
3. A party that has prepared a technical regulation that it considers to be equivalent to a
technical regulation of the other party having compatible objective and product scope may
request in writing that the other party recognise it as equivalent. Such a request shall be made
in writing and set out the detailed reasons why the technical regulations should be considered
to be equivalent, including reasons with respect to product scope. The Party which does not
agree that the technical regulations are equivalent shall provide to the other Party, upon
request, the reasons for its decision.
ARTICLE 5: STANDARDS
1. The Parties reconfirm their obligations under Article 4.1 of the TBT Agreement to
ensure that their standardising bodies accept and comply with the Code of Good Practice for
the preparation and Adoption of Standards in Annex 3 to the TBT Agreement, and also have
regard to the principles set out in Decisions and Recommendations adopted by the Committee
since 1 January 1995, G/TBT/1/rev.12, , 21 January 2015, Annex to Part I (Decision of the
Committee on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and
Recommendations with relation to Articles 2, 5 and Annex 3 of the Agreement) in the latest
version, issued by the WTO committee on Technical Barriers to Trade.
2. With a view to harmonizing standards on as wide a basis as possible, the Parties shall
encourage their standardizing bodies, as well as the regional standardizing bodies of which
they or their standardizing bodies are Members:
(a) to participate within the limits of their resources, in the preparation of
international standards by relevant international standardizing bodies;
2
(b) to use relevant international standards as a basis for the standards they develop,
except where such international standards would be ineffective or
inappropriate, for instance because of an insufficient level of protection or
fundamental climatic or geographical factors or fundamental technological
problems;
(c) to avoid duplication of, or overlap with the work of international standardizing
bodies;
(d) to review national and regional standards not based on relevant international
standards at regular intervals, with a view to increasing their convergence with
relevant international standards;
(e) to cooperate with the relevant standardization bodies of the other Party in
international standardization activities. That cooperation may be undertaken in
the international standardization bodies or at regional level.
3. The Parties undertake to exchange information on:
(a) their use of standards in support of technical regulations;
(b) each other’s standardization processes, and the extent of use of international
standards, regional or sub-regional standards as a base for their national
standards.
(c) co-operation agreements implemented by either Party on standardization for
example on standardization issues in international agreements with third
parties to the extent this is not explicitly prohibited by such agreements.
4. The Parties recognize that according to the Annex 1 of the TBT Agreement standards
are voluntary. Where standards are made mandatory, through incorporation or referencing in a
draft technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure, the transparency obligations
set out in Article 7 shall be fulfilled.
ARTICLE 6: CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES
1. Principles, provisions and procedures established in respect of development, adoption
and application of technical regulations under Article 4.1., mutatis mutandis, with a view to
avoiding unnecessary obstacles to trade and ensuring transparency and non-discrimination
shall also apply in respect of mandatory conformity assessment procedures.
2. In line with Article 5.1.2. of the TBT Agreement, where a Party requires positive
assurance of conformity with its applicable technical regulations, the Party shall require
conformity assessment procedures that are not more strict or applied more strictly than
necessary to give the importing Party adequate confidence that products conform with the
applicable technical regulations or standards, taking account of the risks non-conformity
would create.
3
3. The Parties recognise that a broad range of mechanisms exist to facilitate the
acceptance of the results of conformity assessment procedures conducted in the territory of
the other Party, including:
(a) the importing Party’s reliance on a supplier’s declaration of conformity;
(b) agreements on mutual acceptance of the results of conformity assessment
procedures with respect to specific technical regulations conducted by bodies
located in the territory of the other Party;
(c) use of accreditation to qualify conformity assessment bodies located in the
territory of either Party;
(d) government designation of conformity assessment bodies, including bodies
located in the territory of the other Party;
(e) unilateral recognition by a Party of the results of conformity assessment
procedures conducted in the other Party's territory;
(f) voluntary arrangements between conformity assessment bodies in the territory
of each Party;
(g) use of regional and international multilateral recognition agreements and
arrangements of which the Parties are members.
4. Having regard in particular to those considerations, the Parties undertake:
(a) to intensify their exchange of information on these and similar mechanisms
with a view to facilitating the acceptance of conformity assessment results;
(b) to exchange information on conformity assessment procedures, and in
particular on the criteria used to select appropriate conformity assessment
procedures for specific products;
(c) to consider a supplier’s declaration of conformity as assurance of conformity
among the options for showing conformance with domestic law;
(d) to consider arrangements on mutual acceptance of the results of conformity
assessment procedures according to the procedure set out in paragraph 5 of this
Article;
(e) to exchange information on accreditation policy and to consider how to make
best use of international standards for accreditation, and international
agreements involving the Parties' accreditation bodies, for example, through
the mechanisms of the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation
(ILAC) and the International Accreditation Forum (IAF);
(f) to consider joining or, as applicable, encourage their testing, inspection and
certification bodies to join any functioning international agreements or
4
arrangements for harmonization and/or facilitation of acceptance of conformity
assessment results;
(g) to ensure that economic operators have a choice amongst conformity
assessment facilities designated by the authorities to perform the tasks required
by law to assure compliance;
(h) to endeavour to use accreditation to qualify conformity assessment bodies;
(i) to ensure that there is independence and there are no conflicts of interest
between accreditation bodies and conformity assessment bodies;
5. Upon request from another Party, the Parties may decide to engage in consultation
with a view of defining sectoral initiative regarding the use of conformity assessment
procedures or the facilitation of acceptance of conformity assessment results that are
appropriate for the respective sectors. The Party making the request should substantiate it with
relevant information on how this sectoral initiative would facilitate trade. Where a Party
declines such a request from the other Party, it shall upon request explain its reason.
6. The Parties reaffirm their obligation under Article 5.2.5 of the TBT Agreement that
fees imposed for mandatory conformity assessment of imported products shall be equitable in
relation to any fees chargeable for assessing the conformity of like products of national origin
or originating in any other country, taking into account communication, transportation and
other costs arising from differences between location of facilities of the applicant and the
conformity assessment body.
ARTICLE 7: TRANSPARENCY
The Parties acknowledge the importance of transparency with regard to the preparation,
adoption and application of standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment
procedures. In this regard, the Parties reaffirm their transparency obligations under the TBT
Agreement, and agree:
(a) to take the other Party's views into account where a part of the process of developing a
technical regulation is open to public consultation, and on request to provide written
responses in a timely manner to the comments made by the other Party;
(b) to ensure that economic operators and other interested persons of the other Party are
allowed to participate in any formal public consultation process concerning the
development of technical regulations, on terms no less favourable than those accorded
to its own legal or natural persons;
(c) further to Article 4.1(a), in cases where impact assessments are carried out, to inform
the other Party, upon request, of the outcome of the impact assessment of the proposed
technical regulation;
(d) when making notifications in accordance with Article 2.9.2 or 5.6.2 of the TBT
Agreement, to:
5
(i) allow in principle at least 60 days following the notification for the other
Party to provide comments in writing to the proposal; where practicable, to
give appropriate consideration to reasonable requests for extending the
comment period;
(ii) provide the electronic version of the notified text with the notification;
(iii) provide, in case the notified text is not in one of the official WTO
languages, a detailed and comprehensive description of the content of the
measure in the notification format;
(iv) reply in writing to written comments received from the other Party on the
proposal, no later than the date of publication of the final technical
regulation or conformity assessment procedure;
(v) provide information on the adoption and the entry into force of the notified
measure and the adopted final text through an addendum to the original
notification.
(e) allow sufficient time between the publication of technical regulations and their entry
into force for economic operators of the other Party to adapt, except where urgent
problems of safety, health, environmental protection or national security arise or
threaten to arise;
(f) ensure that all technical regulations and mandatory conformity assessment procedures
adopted and in force are publicly available on official websites, and free of charge;
(g) ensure that the TBT Enquiry Point provides information and answers in one of the
official WTO languages to reasonable enquiries from the other Party or from
interested parties of the other Party on adopted technical regulations, conformity
assessment procedures and standards
ARTICLE 9: MARKET SURVEILLANCE
The Parties undertake to:
(a) exchange views on market surveillance and enforcement activities;
(b) ensure that market surveillance functions are carried out by the competent
authorities, and ensure that no conflicts of interest exist between the market
surveillance function and the conformity assessment function;
(c) ensure that there are no conflicts of interest between market surveillance
bodies and the economic operators subject to control or supervision.
ARTICLE 10: MARKING AND LABELLING
1. The Parties note that a technical regulation may include or deal exclusively with
marking or labelling requirements, and agree that where their technical regulations contain
mandatory marking or labelling, they will observe the principles of Article 2.2 of the TBT
6
Agreement and, in particular, that technical regulations should not be prepared with a view to,
or with the effect of, creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade, and should not be
more trade restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective.
2. In particular, the Parties agree that where a Party requires mandatory marking or
labelling of products:
(a) the Party shall only require information which is relevant for consumers or
users of the product and/or to indicate the product's conformity with the
mandatory technical requirements;
(b) unless necessary in view of the risk of the products to human, animal or plant
health or life, the environment or national safety, such Party shall not require
any prior approval, registration or certification of the labels or markings of
products as a precondition for placing on its market products that otherwise
comply with its mandatory technical requirements. This provision is without
prejudice to the right of the Party to require prior approval of the specific
information to be provided on the label or marking in the light of the relevant
domestic regulations;
(c) where the Party requires the use of a unique identification number by economic
operators, the Party shall issue such number to the economic operators of the
other Party without undue delay and on a non-discriminatory basis;
(d) provided it is not misleading, contradictory or confusing in relation to the
information required in the importing Party of the goods, the Party shall permit
the following:
i. information in other languages in addition to the language required in
the importing Party of the goods;
ii. internationally-accepted nomenclatures, pictograms, symbols or
graphics;
iii. additional information to that required in the importing Party of the
goods;
(e) the Party shall accept that labelling, including supplementary labelling and/or
corrections to labelling, take place, where relevant, in authorized premises (for
example, in customs or bonded licensed warehouses at the point of import) in the
importing Party prior to the distribution and sale of the product. The Party may
require that the original labelling is not removed;
(f) the Party shall, in cases where it considers that legitimate objectives under the
TBT Agreement are not compromised thereby, endeavour to accept non-
permanent or detachable labels, or marking or labelling in the accompanying
documentation rather than physically attached to the product.

ARTICLE 11: JOINT CO-OPERATION AND TRADE FACILITATION
1. The Parties shall strengthen their co-operation in the field of standards, technical
regulations and conformity assessment procedures with a view to increasing the mutual
understanding of their respective systems and to facilitating trade between the Parties. To this
end, they may establish regulatory dialogues at both the horizontal and sectoral levels.
2. The Parties shall seek to identify, develop and promote trade facilitating bilateral
initiatives regarding standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures
that are appropriate for particular issues or sectors. Such initiatives may include:
(a) promoting good regulatory practices through regulatory cooperation, including the
exchange of information, experiences and data with a view to improving the quality
and effectiveness of their standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment
procedures and making efficient use of regulatory resources;
(b) using a risk-based approach to conformity assessment (for instance, relying on a
supplier’s declaration of conformity for low-risk products) and, where appropriate,
reduce the complexity of technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment
procedures;
(c) increasing the convergence of their standards, technical regulations and conformity
assessment procedures with relevant international standards, guides or
recommendations;
(d) avoiding unnecessary divergence of approach of standards, technical regulations and
conformity assessment procedures where no international standards, guides or
recommendations exist;

public or private, responsible for standardisation, conformity assessment and
metrology;
(f) ensuring efficient interaction and cooperation of regulatory authorities at regional or
international level;
(g) exchanging information, insofar as possible, about TBT-related agreements and
arrangements subscribed to at international level.
3. Upon request, a Party shall give appropriate consideration to proposals that the other
Party makes for co-operation under the terms of this Chapter. This cooperation shall be
undertaken, inter alia, through dialogue in appropriate channels, joint projects, technical
assistance and capacity-building programmes on standards, technical regulations and
conformity assessment procedures in selected industrial areas, as mutually agreed.
ARTICLE 12: CONSULTATIONS
1. The Parties shall give prompt and positive consideration to any request from another Party
for consultations on issues relating to the implementation of this Chapter.
8
2. In order to clarify or resolve such issues, the Parties concerned may establish an ad hoc
working group with a view to identifying a workable and practical solution to facilitate trade.
The ad hoc working group shall comprise representatives of the Parties concerned.
ARTICLE 13: IMPLEMENTATION
1. The Parties shall designate a Contact point in the Ministry of Science and Technology and
the European Commission. They shall provide the other Party with the name and the contact
details of relevant officials in that organization, including information on telephone, facsimile,
