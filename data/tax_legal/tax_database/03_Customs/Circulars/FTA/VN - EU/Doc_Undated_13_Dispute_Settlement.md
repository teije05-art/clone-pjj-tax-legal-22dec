ARTICLE 12
Compliance with the Arbitration Panel Report
The Party complained against shall take any measure necessary to comply promptly and in
good faith with the arbitration panel report.
ARTICLE 13
The Reasonable Period of Time for Compliance
1. If immediate compliance is not possible, the Parties shall endeavour to mutually agree
on the period of time to comply with the arbitration panel report. In such a case, the
Party complained against shall, no later than 30 days after the receipt of the
notification of the arbitration panel report to the Parties, notify the complaining Party
and the Trade Committee of the time it will require for compliance ("reasonable
period of time").
2. If there is disagreement between the Parties on the reasonable period of time to
comply with the arbitration panel report, the complaining Party shall, within 20 days
of the receipt of the notification made under paragraph 1 by the Party complained
against, request in writing the original arbitration panel to determine the length of the
reasonable period of time. Such request shall be notified simultaneously to the other
Party and to the Trade Committee. The arbitration panel shall notify its ruling to the
Parties and to the Trade Committee within 20 days from the date of the submission of
the request.

progress to comply with the arbitration panel report at least 30 days before the expiry
of the reasonable period of time.

ARTICLE 14
Review of any Measure Taken to Comply
with the Arbitration Panel Report
1. The Party complained against shall notify the complaining Party and the Trade

taken to comply with the arbitration panel report.

at issue and explain how such measure is inconsistent with the provisions referred to
in Article 2, in a manner sufficient to present the legal basis for the complaint clearly.
The arbitration panel shall notify its ruling to the Parties and to the Trade Committee
within 45 days of the date of the submission of the request.
ARTICLE 15
Temporary Remedies in Case of Non-compliance
1. If the Party complained against fails to notify any measure taken to comply with the
arbitration panel report before the expiry of the reasonable period of time, or if the
arbitration panel rules that no measure taken to comply exists or that the measure
notified under Article 14 paragraph 1 is inconsistent with that Party’s obligations
under the provisions referred to in Article 2, the Party complained against shall, if so
requested by the complaining Party and after consultations with that Party, present an
offer for temporary compensation.
2. If the complaining Party decides not to request an offer for temporary compensation
under paragraph 1, or, in case such request is made, if no agreement on compensation
is reached within 30 days after the end of the reasonable period of time or of the
issuance of the arbitration panel ruling under Article 14 that no measure taken to
comply exists or that a measure taken to comply is inconsistent with the provisions
referred to in Article 2, the complaining Party shall be entitled, upon notification to
the other Party and to the Trade Committee, to suspend obligations arising from any
provision referred to in Article 2 at a level equivalent to the nullification or
impairment caused by the violation. The notification shall specify the level of
suspension of obligations. The complaining Party may implement the suspension at
any moment after the expiry of 10 days from the date of receipt of the notification by
the Party complained against, unless the Party complained against has requested
arbitration under paragraph 3.
3. If the Party complained against considers that the level of suspension is not equivalent
to the nullification or impairment caused by the violation, it may request in writing the
original arbitration panel to rule on the matter. Such request shall be notified to the
complaining Party and to the Trade Committee before the expiry of the 10 day period
6
referred to in paragraph 2. The original arbitration panel shall notify its ruling on the
level of the suspension of obligations to the Parties and to the Trade Committee
within 30 days of the date of the submission of the request. Obligations shall not be
suspended until the original arbitration panel has notified its ruling, and any
suspension shall be consistent with the arbitration panel ruling.
4. The suspension of obligations and the compensation foreseen in this Article shall be
temporary and shall not be applied after:
(a) the Parties have reached a mutually agreed solution pursuant to Article 19; or
(b) the Parties have agreed that the measure notified under Article 14 paragraph 1
brings the Party complained against into conformity with the provisions
referred to in Article 2; or
(c) any measure found to be inconsistent with the provisions referred to in Article
2 has been withdrawn or amended so as to bring it into conformity with those
provisions, as ruled under Article 14 paragraph 2.
ARTICLE 16
Review of any measure taken to comply after the adoption of
temporary remedies for non-compliance
1. The Party complained against shall notify the complaining Party and the Trade
Committee of the measure it has taken to comply with the report of the arbitration
panel following the suspension of concessions or following the application of
temporary compensation, as the case may be. With the exception of cases under
paragraph 2, the complaining party shall terminate the suspension of concessions
within 30 days from the receipt of the notification. In cases where compensation has
been applied, and with the exception of cases under paragraph 2, the Party
complained against may terminate the application of such compensation within 30
days from its notification that it has complied with the report of the arbitration
panel.
7
2. If the Parties do not reach an agreement on whether the notified measure brings the
Party complained against into conformity with the provisions referred to in Article 2
within 30 days of the date of receipt of the notification, the complaining Party shall
request in writing the original arbitration panel to rule on the matter. Such a request
shall be notified simultaneously to the other Party and to the Trade Committee. The
ruling of the arbitration panel shall be notified to the Parties and to the Trade
Committee within 45 days of the date of the submission of the request. If the
arbitration panel rules that the measure taken to comply is in conformity with the
provisions referred to in Article 2, the suspension of obligations or compensation, as
the case may be, shall be terminated. Where relevant, the level of suspension of
obligations or of compensation shall be adapted in light of the ruling of the
arbitration panel.
Sub-section 3: Common Provisions
ARTICLE 17
Replacement of Arbitrators
If in an arbitration proceeding under this Chapter, the original arbitration panel, or some of its
members, are unable to participate, withdraw, or need to be replaced because he or she does
not comply with the requirements under the Code of Conduct, the procedure set out in Article
7 shall apply. The time limit for the notification of the reports and rulings, as the case may be,
shall be extended by 20 days.
ARTICLE 18
Suspension and termination of Arbitration and Compliance Procedures
1. The arbitration panel shall, at the request of both Parties, suspend its work at any time
for a period agreed by the Parties not exceeding 12 consecutive months and shall
resume its work before the end of this period at the written request of both Parties.
The Parties shall inform the Trade Committee, accordingly. The arbitration panel may
also resume its work at the end of this suspension period at the written request of any
Party. The requesting Party shall inform the Trade Committee and the other Party,
accordingly. If a Party does not request the resumption of the arbitration panel's work
at the expiry of the agreed suspension period, the authority of the arbitration panel
shall lapse and the procedure shall be terminated. In the event of a suspension, the
time-frames set out in relevant provisions of this Chapter shall be extended by the
amount of time that the work was suspended. The suspension and termination of the
arbitration panel's work are without prejudice to the rights of either Party in another
proceeding subject to Article 24.
2. The Parties may agree to terminate the procedure of the arbitration panel by jointly
notifying the chairperson of the arbitration panel and the Trade Committee at any time
before the issuance of the final report of the arbitration panel.
8
ARTICLE 19
Mutually Agreed Solution
The Parties may reach a mutually agreed solution to a dispute under this Chapter at any time.
They shall jointly notify the Trade Committee and the chairperson of the arbitration panel,
where applicable, of any such solution. If the solution requires approval pursuant to the
relevant domestic procedures of either Party, the notification shall refer to this requirement,
and the dispute settlement procedure shall be suspended. If such approval is not required, or
if the completion of any such domestic procedures is notified, the dispute settlement
procedure shall be terminated.
ARTICLE 20
Information and technical advice
At the request of a Party, or upon its own initiative, the arbitration panel may request any
information it deems appropriate for the arbitration panel proceeding from any source,
including the Parties involved in the dispute. The arbitration panel also has the right to seek
the opinion of experts as it deems appropriate. The arbitration panel shall consult the Parties
before choosing such experts. Any information obtained under this Article must be disclosed
and submitted to the Parties for their comments within the time-frame set by the arbitration
panel.
ARTICLE 21
Rules of interpretation
The arbitration panel shall interpret the provisions referred to in Article 2 in accordance with
customary rules of interpretation of public international law, including those codified in the
Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The arbitration panel shall also take into account
relevant interpretations in reports of panels and the Appellate body adopted by the WTO
Dispute Settlement Body (hereinafter referred to as the “DSB”). The reports and rulings of
the arbitration panel cannot add to or diminish the rights and obligations of the Parties
provided in the provisions referred to in this Agreement.
ARTICLE 22
Decisions and Rulings of the Arbitration Panel
1. The arbitration panel shall make every effort to take any decision by consensus.
Where, nevertheless, a decision cannot be arrived at by consensus, the matter at
issue shall be decided by majority vote. However, in no case dissenting opinions of
arbitrators shall be disclosed.
2. The reports and rulings of the arbitration panel shall be unconditionally accepted by
the Parties. They shall not create any rights or obligations to natural or legal persons.
The reports and rulings shall set out the findings of fact, the applicability of the
relevant provisions referred to in Article 2 and the basic rationale behind any
findings and conclusions that they make. The Trade Committee shall make the
reports and rulings of the arbitration panel publicly available in its entirety within 10
days of its issuance, unless it decides not to do so in order to protect the
confidentiality of confidential information.

Section 4
General Provisions
ARTICLE 23
List of arbitrators
1. The Trade Committee shall, no later than six months after the entry into force of this
Agreement, establish a list of at least 15 individuals who are willing and able to
serve as arbitrators. The list shall be composed of three sub-lists:
(a) one sub-list for Vietnam;
(b) one sub list for the EU;
(c) one sub-list of individuals who are not nationals of either Party and do not have
permanent residence in either Party and who shall act as chairperson to the
arbitration panel.
Each sub-list shall include at least five individuals. The Trade Committee will
ensure that the list is always maintained at this level.
2. Arbitrators shall have specialised knowledge and experience of law and international
trade. They shall be independent, serve in their individual capacities and not take
instructions from any organisation or government, or be affiliated with the
government of any of the Parties, and shall comply with the Code of Conduct under
Annex II to this Agreement.
3. The Trade Committee may establish an additional list of 10 individuals with
knowledge and experience in specific sectors covered by this Agreement. Subject to
the agreement of the Parties, such an additional list shall be used to compose the
arbitration panel in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 7.
ARTICLE 24
Choice of Forum
1. Recourse to the dispute settlement provisions of this Chapter shall be without
prejudice to any action in the WTO framework, including dispute settlement action,
or in any other international agreement to which both Parties are parties.
2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, a Party shall not, for a particular measure,
seek redress for the breach of a substantially equivalent obligation under this
Agreement and under the WTO Agreement or in any other international agreement
to which both Parties are parties in the relevant fora. Once a dispute settlement
proceeding has been initiated, the Party shall not bring a claim seeking redress for
the breach of the substantially equivalent obligation under the other agreement to the
other forum, unless the forum selected first fails for procedural or jurisdictional
reasons to make findings on the claim seeking redress of that obligation.
3. For the purposes of this Article,
(a) dispute settlement proceedings under the WTO Agreement are deemed to be
initiated by a Party’s request for the establishment of a panel under Article 6 of
the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of
Disputes of the WTO (DSU);
10
(b) dispute settlement proceedings under this Chapter are deemed to be initiated
by a Party's request for the establishment of an arbitration panel under Article
5 paragraph 1;
(c) dispute settlement proceedings under any other international agreement are
deemed to be initiated in accordance with that agreement.
4. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude a Party from implementing the suspension
of obligations authorised by the DSB. The WTO Agreement shall not be invoked to
preclude a Party from suspending obligations under this Chapter.
ARTICLE 25
Time limits
1. All time limits laid down in this Chapter, including the limits for the arbitration
panels to notify their reports and rulings, shall be counted in calendar days from the
day following the act or fact to which they refer, unless otherwise specified.
2. Any time limit referred to in this Chapter may be modified by mutual agreement of
the Parties to the dispute. The arbitration panel may at any time propose to the
Parties to modify any time limit referred to in this Chapter, stating the reasons for
the proposal.
