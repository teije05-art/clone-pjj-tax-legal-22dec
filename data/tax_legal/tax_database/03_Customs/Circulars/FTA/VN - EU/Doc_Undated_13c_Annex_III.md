ANNEX III
MEDIATION MECHANISM
ARTICLE 1
Objective
The objective of this Annex is to facilitate the finding of a mutually agreed solution through a
comprehensive and expeditious procedure with the assistance of a mediator.
Section 1
Procedure under the Mediation Mechanism
ARTICLE 2
Request for Information
1. Before the initiation of the mediation procedure, a Party may request at any time in
writing information regarding a measure adversely affecting trade or investment
between the Parties. The Party to which such request is made shall provide, within 20
days, a written response containing its comments on the information contained in the
request.
2. Where the responding Party considers that a response within 20 days is not
practicable, it shall inform the requesting Party of the reasons for the delay, together
with an estimate of the shortest period within which it will be able to provide its
response.
ARTICLE 3
Initiation of the Procedure
1. A Party may request, at any time, that the Parties enter into a mediation procedure.
Such request shall be addressed to the other Party in writing. The request shall be
sufficiently detailed to present clearly the concerns of the requesting Party and shall:
(a) identify the specific measure at issue;
(b) provide a statement of the alleged adverse effects that the requesting Party
believes the measure has, or will have, on trade or investment between the
Parties; and
(c) explain how the requesting Party considers that those effects are linked to the
1
measure.
2. The mediation procedure may only be initiated by mutual agreement of the Parties.
The Party to which a request pursuant to paragraph 1 is addressed shall give
sympathetic consideration to the request and reply by accepting or rejecting it in
writing within 10 days of its receipt.
ARTICLE 4
Selection of the Mediator
1. Upon launch of the mediation procedure, the Parties shall endeavour to agree on a
mediator no later than 15 days after the receipt of the reply to the request referred to in
Article 3 of this Annex.
2. In the event that the Parties are unable to agree on the mediator within the time frame
laid down in paragraph 1, either Party may request the chair of the Trade Committee,
or the chair's delegate, to select the mediator by lot from the list established under
Article 23 paragraph 1 of Chapter X (Dispute Settlement). Representatives of both
Parties shall be invited, with due anticipation, to be present when lots are drawn. In
any event, the lot shall be carried out with the Party or Parties that are present.
3. The chair of the Trade Committee, or the chair's delegate, shall select the mediator
within five working days of the reply referred to in paragraph 2 by either Party.
4. Should the list provided for in Article 23 paragraph 1 of Chapter X(Dispute
Settlement) not be established at the time a request is made pursuant to Article 3 of
this Annex the mediator shall be drawn by lot from the individuals which have been
formally proposed by one or both of the Parties.
5. A mediator shall not be a citizen of either Party, unless the Parties agree otherwise.
6. The mediator shall assist, in an impartial and transparent manner, the Parties in
bringing clarity to the measure and its possible trade effects, and in reaching a
mutually agreed solution. The Code of Conduct for Arbitrators and Mediators,
contained in Annex II to Chapter X (Dispute Settlement), shall apply to mediators,
mutatis mutandis. Rules 3 through 7 (notifications) and 39 through 43 (translation and
interpretation) of the Rules of Procedure, contained in Annex I to Chapter X (Dispute
Settlement), shall apply, mutatis mutandis.

ARTICLE 5
Rules of the Mediation Procedure
1. Within 10 days after the appointment of the mediator, the Party having invoked the
mediation procedure shall present, in writing, a detailed description of the problem to
the mediator and to the other Party, in particular of the operation of the measure at
issue and its trade effects. Within 20 days after the date of delivery of this submission,
the other Party may provide, in writing, its comments to the description of the
problem. Either Party may include in its description or comments any information that
it deems relevant.
2. The mediator may decide on the most appropriate way of bringing clarity to the
measure concerned and its possible trade effects. In particular, the mediator may
organise meetings between the Parties, consult the Parties jointly or individually, seek
the assistance of, or consult with relevant experts and stakeholders and provide any
additional support requested by the Parties. Before seeking the assistance of or
consulting with relevant experts and stakeholders, the mediator shall consult with the
Parties.
3. The mediator may offer advice and propose a solution for the consideration of the
Parties which may accept or reject the proposed solution or may agree on a different
solution. The mediator shall not advise or give comments on the consistency of the
measure at issue with this Agreement.
4. The procedure shall take place in the territory of the Party to which the request was
addressed or, by mutual agreement, in any other location or by any other means.
5. The Parties shall endeavour to reach a mutually agreed solution within 60 days from
the appointment of the mediator. Pending a final agreement, the Parties may consider
possible interim solutions, especially if the measure relates to perishable goods.
6. The solution may be adopted by means of a decision of the Trade Committee. Either
Party may make such solution subject to the completion of any necessary internal
procedures. Mutually agreed solutions shall be made publicly available. The version
disclosed to the public may not contain any information that a Party has designated as
confidential.
7. Upon request of the Parties, the mediator shall issue to the Parties, in writing, a draft
factual report, providing a brief summary of:
(a) the measure at issue in these procedures;
(b) the procedures followed; and
(c) any mutually agreed solution reached as the final outcome of these procedures,
including possible interim solutions.
3
The mediator shall provide the Parties 15 days to comment on the draft factual report.
After considering the comments of the Parties submitted within the period, the
mediator shall submit, in writing, a final factual report to the Parties within 15 days.
The factual report shall not include any interpretation of this Agreement.
8. The procedure shall be terminated:
(a) by the adoption of a mutually agreed solution by the Parties, on the date of
adoption;
(b) by a mutual agreement of the Parties at any stage of the procedure, on the date of
that agreement;
(c) by a written declaration of the mediator, after consultation with the Parties, that
further efforts at mediation would be to no avail, on the date of that declaration;
or
(d) by a written declaration of a Party after exploring mutually agreed solutions
under the mediation procedure and after having considered any advice and
proposed solutions by the mediator, on the date of that declaration.
