TRADE IN GOODS/MARKET ACCESS CHAPTER:
Article X - SPECIFIC MEASURES CONCERNING THE MANAGEMENT OF
PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT
1. The Parties agree to co-operate in combating customs violations related to the
preferential treatment granted under this Title.
2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the Parties shall offer each other administrative
cooperation and mutual administrative assistance in customs and related matters as
part of the implementation and the control of the preferential treatment, which shall
include, inter alia, the following obligations:
(a) to verify the originating status of the product(s) concerned;
(b) to carry out the subsequent verification of the proof of origin and communicate
the results of that verification to the other Party;
(c) to grant authorisation to the requesting Party to conduct enquiry visits in order
to determine the authenticity of documents or accuracy of information relevant
to the granting of the preferential treatment in question.
3. Where in accordance with provisions on administrative co-operation or mutual
administrative assistance in customs matters referred to in paragraph 2 it was
established that a proof of origin was unduly issued in the meaning of the Protocol on
Rules of Origin to this agreement, the importing Party will deny a preferential tariff
treatment to a declarant who claimed it with regard to goods for which the proof of
origin was issued in the exporting party.
4. If the denial of preferences for individual consignment as referred to in paragraph 3
is considered insufficient to implement and control the preferential treatment of a
given product, any Party may, in accordance with the procedure laid down in
paragraph 5, temporarily suspend the relevant preferential treatment of the product(s)
concerned in either of the following cases:
(a) where a Party has made a finding of a systematic customs violation regarding
claims of preferential tariff treatment under this Agreement; or
(b) where a Party has made a finding that the other Party has systematically failed to
comply with the obligations under paragraph 2.
5. The Party which has made a finding referred to in paragraph 4 shall without undue
delay notify the competent authority of the other Party and provide compelling and
verifiable information upon which the finding was based and engage in consultations
with the competent authority of the other Party with a view to achieving a mutually
acceptable solution.
6. If the competent authorities have not achieved a mutually acceptable solution after
thirty days following the notification the Party that has made the finding shall
without undue delay refer it to the Trade Committee.
7. If the Trade Committee has failed to agree on an acceptable solution within sixty
days following the referral, the Party which has made the finding may temporarily
suspend the preferential tariff treatment for the product(s) concerned.
The temporary suspensions of preferential tariff treatment under this Article shall
apply only for a period necessary to protect the financial interests of the Party
concerned and may be applied until the exporting Party provides convincing
1
evidence of the ability to comply with the requirements and to provide sufficient
control of the fulfilment of all the requirements referred to in paragraph 2 and no
longer than three months. Where the conditions that gave rise to the initial
suspension persist after the expiry of the three month period, the Party concerned
may decide to renew the suspension for next three months. The pending suspensions
shall be subject to periodic consultations within the Trade Committee.
8. Each Party shall publish, in accordance with its internal procedures, notices to
importers about any notifications and decisions concerning temporary suspensions
referred to in paragraph 4 and will without undue delay notify the other Party and the
Trade Committee.
