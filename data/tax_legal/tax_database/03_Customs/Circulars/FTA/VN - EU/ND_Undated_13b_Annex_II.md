and impartiality of the dispute settlement mechanism is preserved. Former arbitrators
must comply with the obligations established in rules 15, 16, 17 and 18 of this Code
of Conduct.
Disclosure obligations
3. Prior to confirmation of her or his selection as an arbitrator under Chapter X (Dispute
Settlement), a candidate shall disclose any interest, relationship or matter that is
likely to affect his or her independence or impartiality or that might reasonably create
an appearance of impropriety or bias in the proceeding. To this end, a candidate shall
make all reasonable efforts to become aware of any such interests, relationships and
matters.
4. A candidate or arbitrator shall communicate matters concerning actual or potential
violations of this Code of Conduct only to the Trade Committee for consideration by
the Parties.
5. Once selected, an arbitrator shall continue to make all reasonable efforts to become
aware of any interests, relationships or matters referred to in rule 3 of this Code of
Conduct and shall disclose them. The disclosure obligation is a continuing duty
1
which requires an arbitrator to disclose any such interests, relationships or matters
that may arise during any stage of the proceeding. The arbitrator shall disclose such
interests, relationships or matters by informing the Trade Committee, in writing, for
consideration by the Parties.
Duties of arbitrators
6. Upon confirmation of her or his selection, an arbitrator shall be available to perform
and shall perform her or his duties thoroughly and expeditiously throughout the
course of the proceeding, and with fairness and diligence.
7. An arbitrator shall consider only those issues raised in the proceeding and necessary
for a ruling and shall not delegate this duty to any other person.
8. An arbitrator shall take all appropriate steps to ensure that his or her assistant and
staff are aware of, and comply with, rules 2, 3, 4, 5, 16, 17 and 18 of this Code of
Conduct.
9. An arbitrator shall not engage in ex parte contacts concerning the proceeding.
Independence and impartiality of arbitrators
10. An arbitrator must be independent and impartial and avoid creating an appearance of
impropriety or bias and shall not be influenced by self-interest, outside pressure,
political considerations, public clamour, and loyalty to a Party or fear of criticism.
11. An arbitrator shall not, directly or indirectly, incur any obligation or accept any
benefit that would in any way interfere, or appear to interfere, with the proper
performance of her or his duties.
12. An arbitrator may not use her or his position on the arbitration panel to advance any
personal or private interests and shall avoid actions that may create the impression
that others are in a special position to influence her or him.
13. An arbitrator may not allow financial, business, professional, personal, or social
relationships or responsibilities to influence her or his conduct or judgement.
14. An arbitrator must avoid entering into any relationship or acquiring any financial
interest that is likely to affect her or his impartiality or that might reasonably create
an appearance of impropriety or bias.
Obligations of former arbitrators
15. All former arbitrators must avoid actions that may create the appearance that they
were biased in carrying out their duties or derived advantage from the decision or
ruling of the arbitration panel.
Confidentiality
16. No arbitrator or former arbitrator shall at any time disclose or use any non-public
information concerning a proceeding or acquired during a proceeding except for the
purposes of that proceeding and shall not, in any case, disclose or use any such

information to gain personal advantage or advantage for others or to adversely affect
the interest of others.
17. An arbitrator shall not disclose an arbitration panel ruling or parts thereof prior to its
publication in accordance with Chapter X (Dispute Settlement).
18. An arbitrator or a former arbitrator shall not disclose the deliberations of an
arbitration panel, or any arbitrator's view at any time.

her assistant and staff.
