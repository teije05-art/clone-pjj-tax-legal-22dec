­ reaffirm their obligations under Protocol related to the Madrid Agreement concerning
the International Registration of Marks,
­ shall use the classification provided for in the Nice Agreement Concerning the
International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the
Registration of Marks.2
­ shall simplify and develop its trademark registration procedures using the Trademark
Law Treaty and Singapore Treaty on the Law of Trademarks, inter alia, as reference
points.
Article 5.2 - Rights conferred by a trademark
The registered trademark shall confer on the proprietor exclusive rights therein. The
proprietor shall be entitled to prevent all third parties not having his consent from using in the
course of trade:
(a) any sign which is identical with the trademark for goods or services which are
identical with those for which the trademark is registered3;
(b) any sign which is identical or similar with the trademark for goods or services, which
are identical with or similar to those for which the trademark is registered, where

the Paris Union for the Protection of Industrial Property and the General Assembly of the
2 For greater certainty, a Party is required to follow updated versions of the Nice Classification to the extent
that the updated version has been published by WIPO and for Vietnam, official translation has been
published by its authority.
3 Without prejudice to article 5.5

World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) at the Thirty-Fourth Series of Meetings of
the Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO (September 1999).
Article 5.5 – Exceptions to the Rights Conferred by a Trademark
Each Party:
(a) shall provide for the fair use of descriptive terms4 as a limited exception to the rights
conferred by trademarks; and
(b) may provide for other limited exceptions,
provided that these exceptions take account of the legitimate interests of the owners of the
trademarks and of third parties.
Article 5.6 - Grounds for revocation5
1. The Parties shall provide that a trademark registration shall be liable to revocation6 if,
within a continuous period of five years prior to a request for revocation, it has not been put to
genuine7 use by its owner or his/her licensee in the relevant territory in connection with the
goods or services in respect of which it is registered, without justifiable reasons, except where
the use is commenced or resumed at least 3 months before the request for revocation. Parties
may provide that this, however, be disregarded where preparations for the commencement or
resumption occur only after the proprietor becomes aware that the request for revocation may
be filed.
2. A Party may provide that a trademark can be liable to revocation if, after the date on which
it was registered in consequence of acts or inactivity of the proprietor, it has become the
common name in the trade for a product or service in respect of which it is registered.
3. Any use of a registered trademark by the proprietor of the trademark or with his consent in
respect of the goods or services for which it is registered, that is liable to mislead the public,
particularly as to the nature, quality or geographical origin of those goods or services shall
make the trademark liable to revocation or alternatively be prohibited by relevant domestic
law.
4 The fair use of descriptive terms includes the use of a sign to indicate the geographic origin of the goods or
services, and where such use is in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters.
5 For Vietnam “revocation” is equivalent to “termination”.
7 Genuine use implies real use for the purpose of trading in the goods or services in question so as to generate
goodwill. In general, this implies actual sales and there must have been some sales of the goods or providing of
the services during the relevant period of time. Use in advertising may amount to genuine use. However, mere
preparatory steps are not to be regarded as genuine use of a mark. Genuine use is opposed to token or artificial
use designed solely to maintain the trade mark on the register.

Article 6.1 - Scope of application
1. This Article applies to the recognition and protection of geographical indications for
wines, spirits, agricultural products and foodstuffs which are originating in the territories of
the Parties.

1. Each Party shall maintain its system for the registration and protection of geographical
indications, which shall contain at least the following elements:

reputation or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its
geographical origin;
(c) an objection procedure that allows the legitimate interests of any natural or
legal person to be taken into account;

extensive protection than is required by this Agreement, provided that such protection
does not contravene the protection provided under this Agreement.

indications of the European Union listed in {Annex GI – I, Part A}, Vietnam
recognises that they are geographical indications within the meaning of paragraph 1 of

under the system referred to in Article 6.2. Vietnam undertakes to protect those
8 Without prejudice to the legislation on the system of registration and protection of geographical indications,
each Party shall provide for legal means for the invalidation of the registration of geographical indications.
9
geographical indications according to the level of protection laid down in this
Agreement.
2. Having completed an objection procedure and having examined the geographical
indications of Vietnam listed in {Annex GI – I, Part B}, the European Union
recognises that they are geographical indications within the meaning of paragraph 1 of
Article 22 of the TRIPS Agreement that have been registered by Vietnam under the
system referred to in Article 6.2. The European Union undertakes to protect those
geographical indications according to the level of protection laid down in this
Agreement.

"Registered”.
Article 6.5 – Protection of geographical indications
1. Each Party shall provide the legal means for interested parties to prevent:
(a) the use of a geographical indication of the other Party listed in {Annex GI – I}
for any product that falls within the product class specified in {Annex GI – I}
for that geographical indication and that either:
i. does not originate in the country of origin specified in {Annex GI – I}
for that geographical indication; or
ii. does originate in the country of origin specified in {Annex GI – I} for
that geographical indication but was not produced or manufactured in
accordance with the laws and regulations of the other Party that would
apply if the product was for consumption in the other Party;
(b) the use of any means in the designation or presentation of a good that indicates
or suggests that the good in question originates in a geographical area other
than the true place of origin in a manner which misleads the public as to the
geographical origin or nature of the good; and,
10
(c) any other use which constitutes an act of unfair competition within the meaning
of Article 10bis of the Paris Convention (1967).
The protection referred to in subparagraph (a) shall be provided even where the true
origin of the product is indicated or the geographical indication is used in translation
or accompanied by expressions such as "kind", "type", "style", "imitation" or the like.
2. Without prejudice to Article 23 of the Agreement on the TRIPS Agreement, the
Parties shall mutually decide the practical conditions of use under which the
homonymous geographical indications will be differentiated from each other, taking
into account the need to ensure equitable treatment of the producers concerned and
that consumers are not misled. A homonymous name which misleads the consumer
into believing that products come from another territory shall not be registered even if
the name is accurate as far as the actual territory, region or place of origin of the
product in question is concerned.
3. Where a Party, in the context of negotiations with a third party, proposes to protect a
geographical indication of the third party which is homonymous with a geographical
indication of the other Party protected under this Article, the latter shall be informed
and be given an opportunity to comment before the third party’s geographical
indication becomes protected.
4. Nothing in this Article shall oblige a Party to protect a geographical indication of the
other Party which is not or ceases to be protected in its country of origin. Each Party
shall notify the other Party if a geographical indication ceases to be protected in the
country of origin. Such notification shall take place in accordance with procedures laid
down in Article 6.11(3).

likely to mislead the consumer as to the true origin of the product in case it conflicts
with the name of a plant variety or an animal breed.

of this Article during which the use of the geographical indication, or its translation,
transliteration or transcription, listed in Part A of {Annex GI – I} and identified by

11
including their successors, who made actual commercial use in good faith of this
indication with regard to products in the class of “wines”.

use or registration of a trademark must be presented within five years after the adverse
use of the protected indication has become generally known in that Party or after the

published by that date, if such date is earlier than the date on which the adverse use
became generally known in that Party, provided that the geographical indication is not
used or registered in bad faith.

the course of trade, that person's name or the name of that person's predecessor in
business, except where such name is used in such a manner as to mislead the public.

protected geographical indication shall not be subject to any registration of users, or further
charges.

a trademark have been acquired through use in good faith, in a Party before the
applicable date set out in paragraph 2, measures adopted to implement this Article 6 in
that Party shall not prejudice eligibility for or the validity of the trademark, or the right
to use the trademark, on the basis that the trademark is identical with, or similar to a

(a) the date of entry into force of this Article/Agreement regarding geographical
indications referred to in Article 6.3; or,

protection of the geographical indication, provided that no grounds for the trademark's
invalidity or revocation exist in the legislation on trademarks of the Parties.

Article 7
Industrial Designs
Article 7.1 - International Agreements
The Parties shall accede19 to the Geneva Act to the Hague Agreement Concerning the
International Registration of Industrial Designs (1999).
Article 7.2 - Protection of Registered Industrial Designs
1. The Parties shall provide for the protection of independently created industrial designs20
that are new or original21. This protection shall be provided by registration and shall confer an
exclusive right upon their holders in accordance with the provisions of this article.22
2. A design applied to or incorporated in a product which constitutes a component part of a
complex product shall only be considered to be new and original:
19 Within the period of 2 years from the entry into force this Agreement
20 The Parties agree that when the domestic law of a Party so provides, a design means the appearance of the
whole product or a separable and/or inseparable part of product.
21 The Parties agree that when the domestic law of a Party so provides, individual character of designs can also
be required. This refers to designs that significantly differ from known designs or combinations of known
designs’ features. The Union considers designs to have individual character if the overall impression it
produces on the informed users differs from the overall impression produced on such a user by any design
which has been made available to the public.
22
It is understood that designs are not excluded from protection simply on the basis that they constitute a part of
an article or product, provided that they are visible, fulfil the criteria of this paragraph, and:
(a) fulfil any other criteria for design protection; and
(b) are not otherwise excluded from design protection,
under the Parties’ respective domestic law.
28
(a) if the component part, once it has been incorporated into the complex product, remains
visible during normal use of the latter, and
(b) to the extent that those visible features of the component part fulfil in themselves the
requirements as to novelty and originality.
3. "Normal use" within the meaning of paragraph 2(a) shall mean use by the end user,
excluding maintenance, servicing or repair work.
4. The owner of a registered design shall have the right to prevent third parties not having the
owner’s consent at least from making, offering for sale, selling, importing, or stocking for
sale a product bearing or embodying the protected design when such acts are undertaken for
commercial purposes.
5. The duration of protection available shall amount to at least 15 years.
Article 7.4 – Exceptions and exclusions
The Parties may provide limited exceptions to the protection of designs, provided that such
exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with the normal exploitation of protected designs,
and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the owner of the protected
design, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties.
2. Industrial design protection shall not extend to designs dictated essentially by technical or
functional considerations.
Article 7.5 - Relationship to Copyright
A design shall also be eligible for protection under the law of copyright of that Party as from
the date on which the design was created or alternatively fixed in any form. Protection
eligibility, the extent to which, and the conditions under which, such a copyright protection is
conferred, including the level of originality required, shall be determined by that Party.

on Paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health.
Article 8.3 - Administrative Authorisation
1. Parties recognise that pharmaceutical products protected by a patent on their respective
territory are generally subject to an administrative authorisation procedure before being put on
their market, hereinafter referred to as the "marketing authorisation procedure".
Parties shall provide for an adequate and effective mechanism to compensate the patent owner
for the reduction in the effective patent life resulting from unreasonable delays in the granting
of first marketing authorisation in the respective territories23. Such compensation may be in
the form of an extension of the duration of the rights conferred by patent protection, equal to
the time by which the period mentioned in footnote 15 is exceeded. The maximum duration of
this extension shall not exceed 2 years.
2. Alternatively to paragraph 1 of this Article, a Party may make available an extension, not
exceeding five years24 of the duration of the rights conferred by the patent protection to
compensate the patent owner for the reduction in the effective patent life as a result of the
marketing authorisation procedure. The duration of the extension shall take effect at the end
of the lawful term of the patent for a period equal to the period which elapsed between the
date on which the application for a patent was filed and the date of the first marketing
authorization to place the product on the market in the party, reduced by a period of five
years.

unfair commercial use. In addition, each Party shall protect such data against disclosure,
except where necessary to protect the public.
[B]. Each Party shall provide that for data of a type referenced in paragraph [A] that are
submitted to the Party after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, no other applicant
for product approval may, without permission of the person that submitted them, rely on that
data in support of an application for product approval during a reasonable period shall
normally mean not less than five years from the date on which the Party granted approval to
the person that produced the data for approval to market its product.
Article 11

The Parties shall protect plant varieties rights, in accordance with the International
Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) as lastly revised in Geneva
on March 19, 1991, (the so-called "1991 UPOV ACT") including the exceptions to the

Civil Enforcement
Article 14
Provisional Measures
1. The Parties shall ensure that, the competent judicial authorities may, on request by
a party who has presented reasonably available evidence to support his claims that his
intellectual property right has been infringed or is about to be infringed, order prompt and
effective provisional measures:
a) to prevent an infringement of any intellectual property right from occurring, and
in particular to prevent the entry into and the movement within the channels of commerce
in their jurisdiction of goods, including imported goods immediately after customs
clearance:
(i) An interlocutory injunction may also be issued against a party whose services are
being used by a third party to infringe an intellectual property right and over whom the
relevant judicial authority exercises jurisdiction.
(ii) In the case of an alleged infringement committed on a commercial scale, the Parties
shall ensure that, if the applicant demonstrates circumstances likely to endanger the
recovery of damages, the judicial authorities may order the precautionary seizure or
blocking of the movable and immovable property of the alleged infringer, including the
blocking of his/her bank accounts and other assets.
32
(b) to preserve relevant evidence in respect of the alleged infringement, subject to the
protection of confidential information. These measures may include the detailed
description, with or without the taking of samples, or the physical seizure of the alleged
infringing goods, and, in appropriate cases, the materials and implements used in the
production and/or distribution of these goods and the documents relating thereto.
2. Where appropriate, in particular where any delay is likely to cause irreparable harm to
the right holder or where there is a demonstrable risk of evidence being destroyed, the
judicial authorities shall have the authority to adopt those provisional measures without
the other party being heard.
3. The provisions of this Article are without prejudice to Article 50 of the TRIPS
Agreement.
Article 15
Evidence
Parties shall ensure that, on application by a party which has presented reasonably available
evidence sufficient to support its claims, and has, in substantiating those claims, specified
evidence which lies in the control of the opposing party, the competent judicial authorities
may order that such evidence be presented by the opposing party, subject to the protection of
confidential information. For the purposes of this paragraph, Parties may provide that a
reasonable sample of a substantial number of copies of a work or any other protected object
be considered by the competent judicial authorities to constitute reasonable evidence.
In the case of an infringement committed on a commercial scale Parties shall take such
measures as are necessary to enable the competent judicial authorities to order, where
appropriate, on application by a party, the communication of banking, financial or commercial
documents under the control of the opposing party, subject to the protection of confidential
information.
Article 16
Right of Information
1. Without prejudice to its domestic law governing the protection of confidentiality of
information or processing of personal data, each Party shall provide that, in civil
proceedings concerning an infringement of an intellectual property right and in response
to a justified and proportionate request of the applicant, the competent judicial authorities
may order the infringer or, in the alternative, the alleged infringer, and/or any other
person indicated below, to provide information as laid down in its applicable laws and
regulations that the infringer or alleged infringer, or any other party possesses or controls.
‘Any other person’ in this paragraph may include a person who:
(i) was found in possession of the infringing goods on a commercial scale;
(ii) was found to be using the infringing services on a commercial scale;
33
(iii) was found to be providing on a commercial scale services used in infringing activities;
or
(iv) was indicated by the person referred to in this subparagraph as being involved in the
production, manufacture or distribution of the goods or the provision of the services.
2. The relevant information referred to in paragraph 1 may include information regarding
any person involved on a commercial scale in the infringement or alleged infringement
and regarding the means of production and distribution networks of the goods or services
which infringe an intellectual property right.
Article 17
Other Remedies
1. The Parties shall ensure that the competent judicial authorities shall have the
authority to order, at the request of the applicant and without prejudice to any damages
due to the right holder by reason of the infringement, and without compensation of any
sort, in such a manner as to minimize the risks of further infringements:
(a) the recall from the channels of commerce;26
(b) the disposal outside the channels of commerce or;
(c) the destruction
of goods that they have found to be infringing an intellectual property right. The
competent judicial authorities may also order destruction of materials and implements,
whose predominant use of which has been in the creation or manufacture of those goods,
or their disposal outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to minimise the
risks of further infringement.
2. The Parties' judicial authorities shall have the authority to order that the remedies
under this Article, at least for the destruction, including the removal from the channels of
commerce for destruction, be carried out at the expense of the infringer, unless particular
reasons are invoked for not doing so.
Article 18
Injunctions
The Parties shall ensure that, where a judicial decision is taken finding an infringement of
an intellectual property right, the judicial authorities may issue against the infringer and
where appropriate, against a party whose services are being used by the infringer and over
whom the relevant judicial authority exercises jurisdiction, an injunction aimed at
prohibiting the continuation of the infringement.
Article 19
Alternative Measures
26 Parties will ensure that this provision applies to infringing goods found in the channels of commerce and that
infringers should be ordered to at least recall the goods back from its customers (for example wholesalers,
distributors, retailers).
34
The Parties may provide that, in appropriate cases and at the request of the person liable
to be subject to the measures provided for in Article 17 (Corrective measures) and/or
Article 18 (Injunctions), the competent judicial authorities may order pecuniary
compensation to be paid to the injured party instead of applying the measures provided
for in these two Articles if that person acted unintentionally and without negligence, if
execution of the measures in question would cause him disproportionate harm and if
pecuniary compensation to the injured party appears reasonably satisfactory.
Article 20
Damages
1. The Parties shall ensure that the judicial authorities have the authority to order the
infringer who knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engaged in an infringing
activity, to pay the right-holder damages to compensate for the actual injury the right
holder has suffered as a result of the infringement.
In determining the amount of damages for infringement of intellectual property rights, a
Party’s judicial authorities shall have the authority:
(a) to take into account all appropriate aspects, such as the negative economic
consequences, including lost profits, which the injured party has suffered, any unfair profits
made by the infringer27 and, in appropriate cases, elements other than economic factors28
(b) in appropriate cases, to set the damages as a lump sum on the basis of elements
such as at least the amount of royalties or fees which would have been due if the infringer
had requested authorisation to use the intellectual property right in question.
2. Where the infringer did not knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know,
engage in infringing activity, the Parties may lay down that the judicial authorities may
order in favour of the injured party the recovery of profits or the payment of damages
which may be pre-established.
