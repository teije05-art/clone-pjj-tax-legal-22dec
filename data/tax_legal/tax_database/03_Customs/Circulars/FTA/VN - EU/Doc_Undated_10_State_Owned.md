SECTION III: STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES, ENTERPRISES GRANTED SPECIAL RIGHTS
OR PRIVILEGES AND MONOPOLIES
Article 1
Definitions
For the purposes of this Section, the following definitions shall apply:
(a) “State-owned enterprise” means an enterprise, including any subsidiary, in which a
Party, directly or indirectly:
(a) owns more than 50% of the enterprise’s subscribed capital or the votes attached
to the shares issued by the enterprise; or
(b) can appoint more than half of the members of the enterprise’s board of directors
or an equivalent body; or
(c) can exercise control over the strategic decisions of the enterprise.
(b) "Enterprise granted special rights or privileges" means any enterprise, including
any subsidiary, public or private that has been granted by a Party, in law or in fact,
special rights or privileges.
(c) A "designated monopoly” means an entity engaged in a commercial activity,
including a group of entities or a government agency, and any subsidiary thereof,
that in a relevant market in the territory of a Party is designated as the sole supplier
or purchaser of a good or service, but does not include an entity that has been
granted an exclusive intellectual property right solely by reason of such grant.
(d) "Special rights or privileges" means rights or privileges granted by a Party to a
limited number of enterprises, or any subsidiaries thereof, within a given
geographical area or a product market the effect of which is to substantially limit
the ability of any other enterprise to carry out its activity in the same geographical
area or a product market in like circumstances. The granting of a license or a permit
to a limited number of enterprises in allocating a scarce resource through objective,
proportional and non-discriminatory criteria is not in and of itself a special right or
privilege.
(e) “commercial activities” means activities, the end result of which is the production
of a good or supply of a service, which will be sold in the relevant market in
quantities and at prices determined by the enterprise, and are undertaken with an
orientation towards profit-making1.
(f) "commercial considerations" means price, quality, availability, marketability,
transportation and other terms and conditions of purchase or sale; or other factors
1 For greater certainty, activities undertaken by an enterprise which operates on a not-for-profit
basis or on a cost-recovery basis are not activities undertaken with an orientation toward profit-making
1
that would normally be taken into account in the commercial decisions of an
enterprise operating according to market economy principles in the relevant
business or industry.
(g) "Designate" means to establish or authorize a monopoly, or to expand the scope of
a monopoly to cover an additional good or service

markets concerned, and include indications that the enterprise is engaging in practices
that hinder trade or investment between the Parties. For the EU, the provisions of
