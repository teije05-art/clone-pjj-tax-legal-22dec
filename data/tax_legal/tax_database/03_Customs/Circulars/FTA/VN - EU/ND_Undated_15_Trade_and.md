objectives, strategies, policies and priorities, to establish its own levels of domestic protection

accordingly its relevant laws and policies, consistently with the principles of internationally
recognised standards or the agreements, to which it is a party, referred to in Articles 3 and 4.
2. Each Party shall strive to ensure that its laws and policies provide for and encourage
high levels of domestic protection in the environmental and social areas and shall strive to
