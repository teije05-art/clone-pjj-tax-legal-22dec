3 Publishing and printing on a fee or contract basis is to be found in BUSINESS SERVICES under 6.F.p).
4 Includes legal advisory services, legal representational services, legal arbitration and conciliation/mediation services, and legal documentation and certification services.
Provision of legal services is only authorised in respect of public international law, EU law and the law of any jurisdiction where the service supplier or its personnel is
qualified to practice as a lawyer, and, like the provision of other services, is subject to licensing requirements and procedures applicable in the Member States of the
European Union. For lawyers providing legal services in respect of public international law and foreign law, these licensing requirements and procedures may take, inter
alia, the form of compliance with local codes of ethics, use of home title (unless recognition with the host title has been obtained), insurance requirements, simple
registration with the host country Bar or a simplified admission to the host country Bar through an aptitude test and a legal or professional domicile in the host country.
Legal services in respect of EU law shall in principle be carried out by or through a fully qualified lawyer admitted to the Bar in a Member State of the European Union
acting personally, and legal services in respect of the law of a Member State of the European Union shall in principle be carried out by or through a fully qualified lawyer
admitted to the Bar in that Member State acting personally. Full admission to the Bar in the relevant Member State of the European Union might therefore be necessary
for representation before courts and other competent authorities in the EU Party since it involves practice of EU and national procedural law. However, in some Member
States, foreign lawyers not fully admitted to the Bar are allowed to represent in civil proceedings a party being a national of or belonging to the State in which the lawyer
is entitled to practice.
