In BG: Vietnam's lawyers can only provide legal representation services for a Vietnam's national subject to reciprocity and cooperation
with a Bulgarian lawyer. For legal mediation services, permanent residence is required.
5 It includes legal advisory services, legal representational services, legal arbitration and conciliation/mediation services, and legal documentation and certification services. Provision
of legal services is only authorised in respect of public international law, EU law and the law of any jurisdiction where the service supplier or its personnel is qualified to practice as
a lawyer, and, like the provision of other services, is subject to licensing requirements and procedures applicable in the Member States of the European Union. For lawyers
providing legal services in respect of public international law and foreign law, these licensing requirements and procedures may take, inter alia, the form of compliance with local
codes of ethics, use of home title (unless recognition with the host title has been obtained), insurance requirements, simple registration with the host country Bar or a simplified
admission to the host country Bar through an aptitude test and a legal or professional domicile in the host country. Legal services in respect of EU law shall in principle be carried
out by or through a fully qualified lawyer admitted to the Bar in a Member State of the European Union acting personally, and legal services in respect of the law of a Member State
of the European Union shall in principle be carried out by or through a fully qualified lawyer admitted to the Bar in that Member State acting personally. Full admission to the Bar
in the relevant Member State of the European Union might therefore be necessary for representation before courts and other competent authorities in the EU Party since it involves
practice of EU and national procedural law. However, in some Member States, foreign lawyers not fully admitted to the Bar are allowed to represent in civil proceedings a party
being a national of or belonging to the State in which the lawyer is entitled to practice.
