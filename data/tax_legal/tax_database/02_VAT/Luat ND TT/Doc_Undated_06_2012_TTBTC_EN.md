The total value of the construction excluding VAT is 200 billion VND including:
- Value of construction: 80 billion VND

- Value of equipment supplied and installed by party B: 120 billion VND.

- VAT 10%: (80 billion + 120 billion) x 10% = 20 billion VND.

compensations for land clearance under the schemes approved by competent agencies) is 30 billion
VND. The project is reduced by 20% of the land levies payable.

Compensations for land clearance under the approved scheme is 15 billion VND.
The total value of subtracted land is calculated as follows:
- The exempted/reduced land levy is: 30 billion x 20% = 6 billion (VND);

- The land levy payable to the State budget (not including the exempted/reduced land levy) is: 30 billion -
6 billion — 15 billion = 9 billion (VND);

- The total land price deducted to calculate VAT including land levies payable to the State budget (not
including the exempted/reduce land levy) and compensations for land clearance is 9 billion + 15 billion =
24 billion (VND). The total land price deducted is allocated to the number of m? of land allowed to do

transfer contract.

Example 26: In July 2011, company A receive the transfer of rights to use 200m? of land from individual B
valued at 6 billion VND. Company A has a notarized Land use right transfer contract in compliance with

On the invoice, company A specifies:

- Transfer price excluding VAT: 60 billion
- Land price not subject to VAT: 40 billion
- VAT on infrastructure: 2 billion

- Total payment: 62 billion VND


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 13 ---
Company A shall declare and pay VAT as follows:
VAT payable = Output VAT — Deducted input VAT

Assuming the input VAT for building infrastructure of company A being 1.5 billion VND is eligible for
deduction:

VAT payable = 2 billion — 1.5 billion = 0.5 billion VND

Company B continues building infrastructure and builds 10 villas (floor area = 200m?/willa) for sale. Total
input VAT is 3 billion VND.

On April 01, 2012, company B is contracted to sell 01 villa to customer C, the transfer price excluding
VAT of 01 villa is 10 billion, land prices deducted for VAT calculation for 01 villa being sold:

- The value of land use rights (excluding value of infrastructure) at the time of receiving transfer from
company A for 01 villa being sold is: 20 million x 200m? = 4 billion (VND)

- The value of infrastructure allocated for 01 villas is:
(20 billion : 2,000m?) x 200m? = 2 billion (VND)

- The value of land use rights (including the value of infrastructure) at the time of receiving transfer from
company A deducted when determining the taxable price of 01 villa being sold is: 6 billion VND.

On the invoice, company B specifies:

- The transfer price of 01 villa: 10 billion VND

- The land price deducted not subject to VAT: 6 billion VND
- VAT: 0.4 billion VND [(10 billion — 6 billion) x 10%]

Assuming company B sold 10 villas within the month, when Company B declares and pays for VAT, the
VAT payable = the output VAT - the deducted input VAT = 0.4 billion x 10 villas — 3 billion = 1 billion VND.

VAT on the value of infrastructure being 2 billion VND specified on the invoice of receiving the transfer
from company A regarding the 10 villas shall not be declared and deducted.

a.5) For real estate establishments conducting business in the form of build-transfer (BT) and exchanging

2. Determination of VAT amount payable:
VAT amount payable: = Output VAT amount - Deducted input VAT amount
In which:

a) The output VAT amount is equal to the total VAT amount of sold goods, services written on the VAT
invoice.

VAT written on VAT invoices is equal to the taxable prices of sold taxable goods, services multiplied by

specify the VAT-exclusive prices, VAT amount and the total amounts payable by the purchasers. For
invoices only specifying the total amount payable (except for special documents) not presenting VAT-
exclusive prices and VAT, the VAT of the goods, services being sold must be calculated on the total
amount payable written on invoices and documents.

Example 39: The enterprise selling steel with sale price of F6 steel is 11,000,000 VND/ton; 10% VAT
equals 1,100,000 VND/ton. For enterprises only specifying the sale price being 12,100,000 VND/ton on a
number of invoices, the VAT calculated on sale revenue shall be 12,100,000 VND/ton x 10% = 1,210,000
VND/ton instead of calculated on the VAT-exclusive price being 11,000,000 VND/ton.

Business establishments must comply regulations on accounting, invoices, documents as prescribed by
law on accounting, invoices and documents. Invoices recorded with wrong VAT rates but not being
adjusted by business establishments, then detected by tax agencies during the inspection shall be

Example 40: In the period, company A pays the deductible input services being special type:

The total amount payable is 110 million VND (included VAT), this kind of service is applied 10% tax rate,
the deductible input VAT is calculated as follows:

110 million

The VAT-exclusive price is 100 million VND, VAT is 10 million VND.

In case invoices recorded with wrong VAT rates but not being adjusted by business establishments.
detected by tax agencies during the inspection shall be handled as follows:

Example 41: Establishments A producing furniture sells 150 products in the month. The total sale amount
is 25 million VND.

The value of supplies and materials purchased to produce 150 products is 19 million VND, including:
+ Primary material (wood): 14 million VND.

+ Other purchased materials and services: 5 million VND.

The VAT rate is 10%, the VAT amount payable by establishment A is calculated as follows:

gold, silver and gem sale minus (-) the cost price of gold, silver and gems being sold.

- For business establishments subject to VAT calculation under the tax deduction method trading gold,
silver, gems applying the method of direct calculation on added value, such establishments must
separately account the input VAT to declare the VAT amount payable of goods, services under each
operation of business and tax calculation method.

--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 24 ---
- Business establishments subject to VAT payment under the method of direct calculation on added value
shall not count the value of purchased assets for investing in fixed assets in the amount of purchased
goods, services to calculate the added value.

If in a tax period, there is negative (-) added value of gold, silver or gems, such negative value shall be
offset against the positive (+) added value of gold, silver or gems. If there is no positive (+) added value or
the positive (+) added value is not enough to cover the negative (-) added value, the deficit shall be
