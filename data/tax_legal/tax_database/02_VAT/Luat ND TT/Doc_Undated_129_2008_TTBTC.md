B. TAX BASES AND TAX CALCULATION METHODS

The bases for calculating VAT are taxable price and tax rate.

|. TAXABLE PRICES

1. Taxable prices of goods or services are specified as follows:

1.1. For goods and services sold or provided by production and business establishments, their taxable
prices are VAT-exclusive sale prices. For goods and services subject to excise tax. Their taxable prices
are sale prices inclusive of excise tax but exclusive of VAT.

The taxable prices of goods or services cover also additional levies and surcharges collected in addition
to the goods or service prices which are enjoyed by business establishments, excluding those which
business establishments shall remit into the state budget. When business establishments apply reduced
sale prices or commercial discounts for their customers (if any), taxable prices are reduced or
commercially discounted sale prices for customers.

1.2. For imported goods, their taxable prices are import prices at border gates plus (+) import duty (if any)
and plus (+) excise tax (if any). Import prices at border gates are determined according to regulations on
dutiable prices of imported goods.

For imported goods eligible for import duty exemption or reduction, their taxable prices are import prices
plus (+) import duty to be paid after the exemption or reduction.

1.3. For goods and services used for barter, internal consumption, presentation as gifts, donation or
payment of salaries to laborers, their taxable prices are taxable prices of goods or services of the same
or similar types at the time such activities are carried out.

Goods and services used for internal consumption are those manufactured or provided by business
establishments for their internal consumption, excluding those for further use in their manufacture or
business operations.

Goods for internal circulation, including those ex-warehoused for transfer from one warehouse to another,
or supplies or semi-finished products ex-warehoused for further use in manufacture operations of a
production or business establishment are not subject to VAT calculation and payment.

Example 2: Establishment A manufactures electric fans and installs 50 fans at its workshops, the sale
price (exclusive of VAT) of this type of fans is VND 1,000,000/fan. The output VAT amount payable for
these internally used fans is:

VND 1,000,000/fan x 50 fans x 10% = VND 5,000,000

Example 3: Establishment B produces garments and has a yarn workshop and a sewing workshop. If it
transfers finished yarn from the yarn workshop to the sewing workshop for further use in the production
process, it is not required to calculate and pay VAT for the yarn quantities ex-warehoused to the sewing
workshop.

Example 4: Production establishment C is engaged in both manufacturing livestock feeds and raising
cattle. VAT shall be imposed on the manufactured livestock feed quantity put for sale but establishment C
is not required to calculate and pay VAT on its livestock feed quantity used for cattle raising which is not
liable to VAT. The creditable input VAT amount on livestock feed manufacture operations shall be
allocated according to the ratio of livestock feed sale turnover to the total of livestock feed sale turnover
and livestock sale turnover.

1.4. For services of leasing such assets as houses, offices, workshops, warehouses, wharves, yards,
means of transport, machinery, equipment, etc., their taxable prices are VAT-exclusive rents.


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 6 ---
In case of leasing with rent paid in installments or prepaid for a leasing term, the taxable price is each
VAT-exclusive rent installment or prepaid rent amount for that leasing term.

In case of lease of foreign machinery, equipment or means of transport which cannot be manufactured at
home for sub-lease, the taxable price is exclusive of the rent payable to the foreign party.

Asset rent rates are those agreed upon by involved parties and stated in their contracts. When a rent rate
bracket is prescribed by law, rent rates must be within that bracket.

1.5. For goods sold on installment or deferred payment, their taxable prices are lump-sum VAT-exclusive
sale prices, excluding interests on installment or deferred payments.

Example 5: A motorbike trading company sells 100 cc Honda motorbikes. The VAT-exclusive installment
sale price of these motorbikes is VND 25.5 million (including an installment payment interest of VND 0.5
million). The taxable price is VND 25 million.

16. For goods processing, taxable prices are VAT-exclusive processing prices under processing
contracts, consisting of remunerations, costs of fuel, power, auxiliary materials and other expenses for
the processing operation.

17. For construction and installation, the taxable price is the VAT-exclusive value of the completed and
handed over work, work item or job.

1.7.1. For cases of construction and installation involving the contracted supply of materials, taxable
prices are construction and installation prices inclusive of the VAT-exclusive value of materials.

Example 6: Construction company B enters into a work construction contract, covering also the value of
construction materials. The VAT-exclusive total payment value is VND 1,500 million, of which the VAT-
exclusive value of construction materials is VND 1,000 million. Then the taxable price is VND 1,500
million.

1.7.2. For cases of construction and installation without the contracted supply of materials, the taxable
price is the construction and installation value exclusive of the VAT-exclusive value of materials.

Example 7: Construction company B enters into a work construction contract not covering the value of
construction materials. If the total VAT-exclusive value of the work is VND 1,500 million and the VAT-

exclusive value of construction materials supplied by investor A is VND 1,000 million, then the taxable
price in this case is VND 500 million (VND 1,500 million - VND 1,000 million).

1.7.3. For cases of construction and installation with payments to be made for each completed and taken-
over construction item or based on the value of the completed and taken-over construction and
installation volume, the taxable price is the VAT-exclusive value of the completed and taken-over
construction item or work volume.

Example 8: Textile company X (party A) hires construction company Y (party B) to perform construction
and installation work to expand a workshop.

The total VAT-exclusive value of the work is VND 200 billion, including:

- The construction and installation value: VND 80 billion

- The value of equipment supplied and installed by party B: VND 120 billion.
- VAT amount 10%: (80 + 120) x 10% = VND 20 billion.

- Total amount payable by party A: VND 220 billion:

- Party A shall:

+ Receive the workshop handed over, account it as an increase of VND 200 billion (VAT-exclusive value)
in the value of its fixed assets for depreciation purpose.

+ Declare and credit the VAT amount of VND 20 billion against the output VAT on sold goods or request
tax refund under regulations.

If party A tests, takes over the work and accepts to make payment to party B per construction item
(presuming that a VND 80-billion construction and installation volume is tested, taken over and paid for
first) then the taxable price is VND 80 billion.

1.8. For real estate business activities, taxable prices are real estate transfer prices minus (-) actual land
prices (or land rent rates) at the time of land transfer. In case land prices at the time of transfer declared
by taxpayers are not reliable for determining reasonable taxable prices under law, land prices to be
subtracted (or land rent rates) are those set by provincial/municipal People’s Committees at the time of
real estate transfer. Land prices to be subtracted for determining taxable prices must not exceed sums of
money collected from land customers.

For establishments building and trading in infrastructure works or building houses for sale or transfer and
collecting sums of money from customers according to the project implementation or payment collection
schedules indicated in contracts, land prices to be subtracted are actual land prices at the time of first
collection according to schedule. Land prices to be subtracted shall be calculated according to the ratio
(%) of sums of money collected according to project implementation or payment collection schedules
indicated in the contracts to actual land prices at the time of transfer (the time of first collection according
to the project implementation or payment collection schedule).

Example 9: Housing Investment and Development Company A is allocated by the State 10,000 m? of
land for building houses for sale. The company sells one house on a land area of 100 m? at a total of
VND 2 billion, exclusive of VAT, including the house sale price and land use rights transfer price (of which


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 7 ---
the price of the house with infrastructure works is VND 1.2 billion and the land use rights transfer price
declared by the Company is VND 8 million per m?).

The managing tax office holds that the price declared by the Company is insufficient for determining a
reasonable taxable price under law.

At the time of transfer, the land price set by the local People’s Committee is VND 6 million per m2, then
the taxable price of the above house is:

VND 2 billion - (VND 6 million x 100/m?) = VND 1.4 billion.
The output VAT is: VND 1.4 billion x 10% = VND 140 million

Example 10: Real Estate Business Company C sells a villa at the price of VND 8 billion as stated in the
transfer contract, including the villa sale price of VND 5 billion and the land price of VND 3 billion.
Company C collects the payment according to the project implementation schedule. The customer makes
the payment in three installments. The first installment is 30% of the contract value (VND 2.4 billion), the
second installment is 50% of the contract value (VND 4 billion) and the third installment is the remaining
20% (VND 1.6 billion), the taxable price for each installment is as follows:

The taxable price for the first installment:

VND 2.4 billion - 30% x VND 3 billion = VND 1.5 billion
The taxable price for the second installment:

VND4 billion - 50% x VND 3 billion = VND 2.5 billion
The taxable price for the third installment:

VND 1.6 billion - 20% x VND 3 billion = VND 1 billion

- For business establishments leased land by the State for building infrastructure works for lease, taxable
prices are VAT-exclusive infrastructure lease rates minus (-) land rents to be remitted into the state
budget.

Example 11: Industrial Park Infrastructure Investment and Dealing Company Y is leased by the State
500,000 m? of land for 50 years for building technical infrastructure works for lease. The land rent rate is
VND 300,000/m?/year. After building infrastructure works, company Y leases 5,000 m? to company Z for
20 years for building a factory at a VAT-exclusive land rent rate (excluding public-facility charges) of VND
800,000/m?/year. Company Z pays the infrastructure rent once a year.

The taxable price for an annual rent from the lease of the infrastructure is:

(5,000 m? x VND 800,000) - (5,000 m? x VND 300,000) x 1 year = VND 2,500,000,000.

The VAT amount is: VND 2,500,000,000 x 10% = VND 250,000,000.

1.9. For goods and service sale and purchase agency and brokerage activities, remunerated or
commissioned import or export consignment activities, taxable prices are VAT-exclusive remunerations
or commissions earned from these activities.

1.10. For goods and services with payment documents showing VAT-inclusive payment prices, such as
stamps, freight or fare tickets or construction lottery tickets, their VAT-exclusive prices shall be
determined as follows:

Payment price (ticket or stamp price)
VAT- exclusive price =

1 + VAT rate of the goods or service (%)

1.11. For electricity supplied by hydropower plants being dependent-accounting units of the Vietnam
Electricity Group, the taxable price for determining payable VAT amounts in a locality where such a plant
is located is equal to 60% of the VAT-exclusive average commercial electricity sale price in the previous
year. In case the average commercial electricity sale price in the previous year cannot be determined, a
price for temporary VAT calculation announced by the Group may apply but must not be lower than the
price of the preceding year. If the average commercial electricity sale price in the previous year can be
determined, declarations for difference adjustment shall be made in the declaration period of the month
when the official price is available. The determination of the average commercial electricity sale price ina
year must be made before March 31 of the following year.

1.12. For casino, prized video game or betting game services, taxable prices are excise tax-inclusive
sums of money earned from these activities minus prizes paid to customers.

The taxable price shall be calculated according to the following formula:

Earned sum of money
Taxable price =

1 + tax rate
Example 12: In a tax period, a casino service establishment records the following Figures:

- Cash amount collected from customers for token exchange at counters before playing games: VND 43
billion.

- Cash amount paid to customers for tokens returned after playing games: VND 10 billion.
Cash amount actually collected by the establishment: VND 43 billion - VND 10 billion = VND 33 billion.


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 8 ---
The cash amount of VND 33 billion is the establishment's turnover inclusive of VAT and excise tax.
The taxable price is calculated as follows:
VND 33 billion
1+10%

1.13. For transportation, loading and unloading, taxable prices are VAT-exclusive freight or loading and
unloading charge rates, regardless of whether establishments directly undertake the transportation,
loading and unloading or hire such service.

Taxable price = VND 30 billion

1.14. For tourist services in the form of tours under contracts signed with tourists at package prices
(inclusive of meal, accommodation and travel), these package prices are regarded as VAT-inclusive
prices.

In case the package price covers also air fares for tourists coming from abroad into Vietnam and from

Vietnam to abroad, expenses for meals, lodgings and sight-seeing and some other expenses incurred
abroad (if with lawful receipts), sums of money collected from tourists to cover these expenses may be
subtracted from taxable prices (turnover).

Example 13: The Ho Chi Minh City Tourist Company performs a package tour contract with Thailand for
50 tourists for five days in Vietnam with a total payment of USD 32,000. The Vietnamese side has to pay
for airfares, meals, accommodation, and sight-seeing tours under the agreed program, of which the
airfares from Thailand to Vietnam and vice versa cost USD 10,000. The applicable USD/VND exchange
rate is 1/17,000.

The taxable price under this contract is determined as follows:
+ Turnover liable to VAT is:
(USD 32,000 - USD 10,000) x VND 17,000 = VND 374,000,000
+ The taxable price is:
VND 374,000,000
1+ 10%

Example 14: Hanoi Tourist Company performs a contract for taking tourists from Vietnam to China ona
five-day tour at the package price of USD 400/person. If it has to pay a Chinese tourist company USD
300/person, its taxable turnover is USD 100/person (USD 400 - USD 300).

1.15. For pawning service, taxable prices are amounts to be collected from this service, including
interests receivable from pawn loans and other proceeds from the sale of pawned articles (if any).

= VND 340,000,000

Revenues from this service, which are determined as above, are VAT-inclusive prices.
Example 15: A pawning company generates in the tax period a pawning turnover of VND 110 million.
+ The taxable price is determined as follows:
VND 110 million
1+ 10%

1.16. For VAT-liable books sold at their distribution prices (cover prices) under the Publication Law, these
sale prices shall be determined as VAT-inclusive prices for calculating selling establishments’ VAT and
turnover. For books which are sold at prices other than their cover prices, VAT shall be calculated on the
basis of actual sale prices.

= VND 100 million

1.17. For printing activities, taxable prices are printing costs. If a printing establishment performs printing
contracts with payment prices covering also printing and paper costs, the taxable price also includes the
paper cost.

1.18. For services of assessment agency, agency for indemnity consideration, agency for claim for
compensations by third parties and agency for handling of wholly compensated goods for remunerations
or commissions, taxable prices are earned VAT-exclusive remuneration or commission amounts (not yet
subtracted with any expenses) collected by the insurance enterprises.

Taxable prices shall be calculated in Vietnam dong. If taxpayers have foreign-currency turnover, they
shall convert it into Vietnam dong at the average inter-bank exchange rate announced by the State Bank
of Vietnam at the time of turnover generation, for determining taxable prices.

2. The time of determining VAT is as follows:

- For sale of goods, it is the time of transfer of the right to own or use goods to purchasers, regardless of
whether sellers have collected the money.

- For provision of services, it is the lime of completing service provision or the time of billing the service
provision, regardless of whether providers have collected the money.

- For supply of electricity and clean water, it is the date of recording water or electricity meter readings for
writing on water or electricity bills.

- For activities of dealing in real estate, building infrastructure or houses for sale, transfer or lease, it is
the time of collection of money according to project implementation or payment collection schedules
stated in contracts. Based on collected sums of money, business establishments shall declare output
VAT amounts arising in the period.

--- PAGE 9 ---
- For construction and installation, it is the time of takeover test and handover of completed works, work
items, construction or installation volumes, regardless of whether contractors have collected the money.

- For imported goods, it is the time of registration of customs declarations.

III. VAT CALCULATION METHODS

Business establishments shall pay VAT by either of the two methods: the tax credit method and the
method of tax calculation directly based on added value.

The subjects of application and the determination of payable VAT amounts by each method are as
follows:

1. The tax credit method:

1.1. The tax credit method applies to business establishments that fully observe the accounting, invoice
and document regime under the law on accounting and keeping of invoices and documents and register
to pay tax by the tax credit method, except those applying the method of tax calculation directly based on
added value specified at Point 2 of this Section.

1.2. Determination of payable VAT amounts:
Payable VAT amount = Output VAT amount - Credited input VAT amount
In which:

a/ The output VAT amount is equal to the total VAT amount of goods sold or services provided indicated
on value added invoices.

The VAT amount indicated on a value added invoice is equal to the taxable price of a taxable good sold
or service provided multiplied by (x) the VAT rate of such good or service.

In case of using vouchers stating a VAT-inclusive payment price, the output VAT amount shall be
determined to be equal to this payment price minus (-) the taxable price specified at Point 1.10, Section II
of this Part.

Business establishments paying VAT calculated by the tax credit method shall, when selling goods or
providing services, calculate and collect VAT on the goods sold or services provided. On invoices issued
for sold goods or provided services, business establishments shall write VAT-exclusive sale prices, VAT
amounts and total amounts payable by purchasers. If on an invoice only the payment price is indicated
(except for cases in which special-type documents may be used) but not the VAT-exclusive price and
VAT amount, the VAT amount on the goods sold or the service provided shall be calculated based on the
payment price indicated on the invoice or document.

Example 17: An enterprise sells iron and steel at a VAT-exclusive sale price of VND 11,000,000/ton of
6 iron rods; the 10% VAT amount is VND 1,100,000/ton, but if on some of its sale invoices only the sale
price of VND 12,100,000/ton is indicated, the VAT amount calculated on the basis of sale turnover shall
be determined as follows: VND 12,100,000/ton x 10% = VND 1,210,000/ton, instead of calculation based
on the VAT-exclusive price of VND 11,000,000/ton.

Business establishments shall observe the accounting, invoice and document regime under the law on
accounting and keeping of invoices and documents and the guidance in Section IV. Part B of this
Circular. For wrong VAT rates stated on invoices which are not yet adjusted by business establishments
themselves but are detected through inspection by tax offices, they shall be handled as follows:


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 12 ---
For business establishments selling goods or providing services: If the VAT rate indicated on invoices is
higher than that prescribed in legal documents on VAT, VAT shall be declared and paid at the VAT rate
indicated on invoices. If the VAT rate indicated on invoices is lower than that prescribed in legal
documents on VAT, VAT shall be declared and paid at the VAT rate prescribed in legal documents on
VAT.

b/ The input VAT amount is equal to (=) total VAT amount indicated on value added invoices for
purchased goods or services (including also fixed assets) used for the production of and trading in VAT-
liable goods and services or to the VAT amount indicated on vouchers on duty payment for imported
goods or VAT payment made on behalf of foreign parties under the Finance Ministry’s guidance for
application to Vietnam-based foreign organizations without the legal entity status and foreigners doing
business or earning incomes in Vietnam.

If purchased goods and services are of the kinds for which special-type documents indicating VAT-
inclusive payment prices are used, business establishments may base themselves on these VAT-
inclusive prices and the calculation method specified at Point 1.10, Section I, Part B of this Circular, to
determine the VAT-exclusive price and input VAT amount.

Example 18: In a tax period, company A made payment for input services of a special type eligible for tax
credit:

The total payment price is VND 110 million (inclusive of VAT). This service is subject to the
tax rate of 10%. The creditable input VAT amount shall be calculated as follows:
VND 110 million
1+10%
The VAT-exclusive price is VND 100 million and the VAT amount is VND 10 million.

For wrong VAT rates indicated on invoices which are not yet adjusted by business establishments
themselves but are detected through inspection by tax offices, they shall be handled as follows:

x10% = VND 10 million

For business establishments purchasing goods or services: If the VAT rate indicated on invoices is higher
than that prescribed in legal documents on VAT, the input VAT shall be credited at the VAT rate
prescribed in these legal documents. If the seller is determined as having declared and paid tax at the tax
rate indicated on invoices, the input VAT may be credited at the VAT rate indicated on invoices but
certification of the tax office directly managing the seller is required. If the VAT rate indicated on invoices
is lower than that prescribed in legal documents on VAT, the input VAT may be credited at the VAT rate
indicated on invoices.

c/ Determination of creditable input VAT:

c. 1/ Input VAT on goods or services used for the production of and trading in VAT-liable goods and
services may be wholly credited.

c.2/ For goods or services used for the production of and trading in both goods or services liable and not
liable to VAT, only the input VAT amount on goods or services used for the production of and trading in
VAT-liable goods or services is creditable. Business establishments shall separately account creditable
and non-creditable VAT amounts. If it is impossible to separately account these amounts, input VAT will
be credited according to the ratio (%) of VAT-liable turnover to total turnover of sold goods or provided
services.

c.3/ Input VAT on fixed assets used for the production of and trading in both goods and services liable
and not liable to VAT may be wholly credited.

Input VAT on fixed assets in the following cases will not be credited but shall be included in the historical
costs of these fixed assets: fixed assets exclusively used for the manufacture of weaponry and military
equipment used in defense and security; houses used as office buildings and equipment exclusively used
for credit operations of credit institutions and reinsurance, life insurance or securities trading enterprises,
hospitals and schools; civil aircraft and yachts not used for commercial cargo and passenger
transportation, tourist or hotel business.

Input VAT on goods and services which form fixed assets of enterprises, such as canteens providing shift
meals, mid-shift accommodations, free houses, locker rooms, parking lots, toilets and water tanks for
laborers working in production or business places, and houses and healthcare stations for laborers
working in industrial parks, may be wholly credited.

For fixed assets being passenger automobiles of 9 seats or less (excluding automobiles used for
commercial cargo or passenger transportation, tourist or hotel business) and valued at more than VND
1.6 billion, input VAT on the value in excess of VND 1.6 billion is not creditable.

c.4/ Establishments engaged in agricultural production, forestry, rearing or fishing aquatic or marine
products and organizing closed production processes, accounting their production and business results in
a centralized manner, and using products at the stage of agricultural production, forestry; rearing and
fishing aquatic or marine products as raw materials for further production and processing into VAT-liable
products (including unprocessed agricultural, forest or aquatic products for export or processed products
liable to VAT) may declare and credit input VAT on goods and services purchased for production and
business at all stages of capital construction investment, production and processing. If they sell goods
that are unprocessed or preliminarily processed agricultural, forest, aquatic or marine products not liable
to VAT, the VAT amount on these purchased goods and services may be credited according to the ratio
(%) of turnover from VAT-liable goods or services to total turnover from sold goods or provided services.


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 13 ---
c.5/ Input VAT on purchased goods or fixed assets which are lost or damaged due to natural disasters,
fires or unexpected incidents is not creditable.

c.6/ Input VAT on goods (including also goods purchased from outside or goods manufactured by
enterprises themselves) used by enterprises for sales promotion or advertisement in various forms to
serve the production of and trading in VAT-liable goods and services is creditable.

c.7/ Input VAT on goods and services used for the production of or trading in goods and services not
liable to VAT specified in Section II, Part A of this Circular may be included in the historical costs of fixed
assets, the value of raw materials or business costs, except for the following cases:

- VAT on goods and services purchased by business establishments for use in the production of or
trading in goods and provision of services to foreign organizations and individuals or international
organizations for provision of humanitarian aid or non-refundable aid specified at Point 19.e, Section II,
Part A of this Circular, may be wholly credited;

- Input VAT on goods and services used in prospecting, exploring and developing oil and gas fields may
be wholly credited.

c.8/ Input VAT arising in a month may be declared for credit immediately when the tax amount payable in
that month is determined, regardless of whether relevant goods or services have been delivered for use
or still remain in stock. If business establishments detect some invoices or VAT payment vouchers not yet
declared for input VAT credit, they may make additional declaration and credit. The time limit for
additional declaration and credit is 6 (six) months from the month when missing invoices and vouchers
are detected.

Example 19: Business establishment A has one value added purchase invoice issued on February 10,
2009. If in the tax declaration period of February 2009, its accountants failed to declare this invoice, it
may make an additional declaration and credit no later than July 2009.

c.9/ Business establishments may either account non-creditable input VAT amounts as expenses for
enterprise income tax calculation or include them in the historical costs of fixed assets under law.

c.10/ Corporations’ or groups’ offices that are not directly engaged in business operations and subsidiary
administrative and non-business units such as hospitals, clinics, sanatoriums, institutes, training schools,
etc., which are not liable to pay VAT, will not be entitled to input VAT credit or refund for goods and
services purchased for their operations.

When these units also deal in VAT-liable goods and services, they shall separately register, declare and
pay VAT for these operations.

Example 20: The office of Corporation A is not directly engaged in production and business activities and
operates with the budget contributed by subsidiary units. If it leases the unused space of its house (office
building), it shall separately account, declare and pay VAT for the office lease. The input VAT on goods
and services used for the operation of the Corporation’s office will be neither credited nor refunded. The
Corporation's office shall pay such input VAT with its budget contributed by its subsidiary units.

1.3. Conditions for input VAT credit are specified as follows:

a/ Having lawful value added invoices of purchased goods or services or vouchers of VAT payment at the
importation stage or vouchers of VAT payment on foreign parties’ behalf under the Finance Ministry's
guidance applicable to foreign organizations without the Vietnamese legal entity status and foreigners
conducting business or earning incomes in Vietnam.

b/ Having vouchers of via-bank payment for purchased goods and services, except for cases in which the
total invoiced value of purchased goods or services at a time is less than VND 20 million calculated at a
VAT-inclusive price.

Without via-bank payment vouchers, input VAT on purchased goods or services with an invoiced value of
more than VND 20 million calculated at a VAT-inclusive price at a time will not be credited. These
invoices shall be declared by business establishments in a separate section in the list of invoices and
vouchers of purchased goods and services.

For goods or services valued at more than VND 20 million purchased on deferred payment or installment
payment, business establishments shall declare and credit input VAT based on goods or service
purchase contracts, value added invoices and via-bank payment vouchers of these goods or services,
and at the same time write the payment time limit in the note section of the list of invoices and vouchers
of purchased goods and services. If via-bank payment vouchers are unavailable for the reason that the
payment under contracts is not due, business establishments may still declare and credit input VAT. If
via-bank payment vouchers are unavailable when the payment under contracts is due, they may not
credit input VAT and shall declare and reduce input VAT amounts already credited for the value of goods
without via-bank payment vouchers.

Example 21: In January 2009, Company A purchases a goods lot from Company B for its production and
business. The total value of the purchase contract is VND 330 million (inclusive VAT at the rate of 10%).
As agreed upon in the contract, Company A shall pay for the goods lot to Company B in May 2009.

In this case, Company A may temporarily declare an input VAT amount of VND 30 million in the
declaration period of January 2009. When the payment is due in May 2009, Company A shall supply a
voucher of via-bank payment of VND 330 million. If Company A fails to supply such via-bank payment
voucher, its temporarily credited VAT amount (VND 30 million) of January 2009 must be declared as a
reduction of the creditable VAT amount of the declaration period of May 2009.


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 14 ---
When the payment is due in May 2009, if Company A can supply a via-bank payment voucher but the
sum of money indicated on this voucher is only VND 275 million, it will be allowed to credit only a VAT
amount of VND 25 million, and at the same time shall reduce the creditable VAT amount of the
declaration period of May 2009 by VND 5 million.

For goods and services purchased by clearing the value of these goods and services against that of sold
goods; clearing debts; and authorizing a third party to make via-bank payment, all these payments will be
treated as via-bank payments if they are specifically provided in purchase contracts. If, after such
payments have been made, the remaining value paid in cash is VND 20 million or more, VAT on this
amount will be credited only if a via-bank payment voucher is available. When declaring input VAT
invoices, business establishments shall clearly state the methods of payment specifically provided in
contracts in the note section of the list of invoices and vouchers of purchased goods and services.

In case a good or service valued at less than VND 20 million is purchased from a supplier several times a
day with a total purchase value of more than VND 20 million, VAT will be credited only when via-bank
payment vouchers are available.

c/ To be eligible for input VAT credit and refund, exported goods and services (except for cases guided at
Point Id and Point le of this Section) must satisfy the conditions and procedures specified at Items a and
b of this Point, and Point 1.2, Section II, Part B of this Circular, specifically:

export consignee and the foreign party; the serial number and date of, and the sum of money indicated
on, the voucher on the via-bank payment made by the export consignee to the foreign party; the serial
number and date of, and the sum of money indicated on, the voucher on the payment made by the export
consignor to the export consignee; the serial number and date of the export consignee’s customs
declaration for the exported goods.

c.2/ Customs declaration of exported goods, with certification by the customs office that the goods have
been exported.

For business establishments exporting software products in the forms of documents, files or packaged
databases, to enjoy input VAT credit and refund, they shall fill in customs declarations procedures
applicable to ordinary goods.

Particularly for the following cases, customs declarations are not required:

- Business establishments that export services or software via electronic means. However, these
business establishments shall comply with all regulations on procedures of certification that the purchaser
has received services or software exported via electronic means in accordance with the law on e-
commerce.

- Construction and installation of works of export processing enterprises.

- Business establishments that supply electricity, water, stationery and goods for daily operations of
export processing enterprises.

c.3/ Via-bank payment for exported goods and services must comply with the following guidance:

Via-bank payment means the transfer of money from the importer’s account into the exporter’s account
opened at a bank in the manner as agreed upon in the contract and required by the bank. Payment
vouchers are credit notes of the exporter’s bank of the sum of money already received from the
importer’s bank account. In case of deferred payment, the agreement thereon must be expressed in the
export contract, and when payment is due, the business establishment must have via-bank payment
vouchers. In case of export consignment, the export consignee shall make via-bank payment to the
foreign party.

- The following cases of payment shall also be regarded as via-bank payment:

+ When payments for exported goods or services are cleared against foreign loans, and business
establishments satisfy all the following conditions, procedures and dossiers:

(1) Borrowing contract (for financial loans of under one year); or loan registration certification paper of the
State Bank of Vietnam (for loans of over one year).

(2) Voucher on transfer of money via bank by the foreign party into Vietnam.

The method of payment for exported goods or services by clearing against foreign loans must be stated
in the export contract.

(3) Written certification by the foreign party of the loan clearing.

(4) Any difference between the value of exported goods or services and the foreign loan must be paid via
bank. Vouchers on such via-bank payment are as guided at this Point.

+ When the exporting business establishment uses payments for exported goods or services as capital
contributions to an overseas importing establishment, and this business establishment satisfies all the
following procedure and dossier requirements:

(1) It has a capital contribution contract.


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 15 ---
(2) The use of payments for exported goods or services as capital contributions to an overseas importing
establishment must be stated in the export contract.

(3) In case the contributed capital amount is smaller than the turnover from exported goods, the
difference must be paid via bank under this Point’s guidance.

+ When the goods or service-exporting establishment applies via-bank payment for exported goods or

establishments providing export services, if they do not satisfy the condition on via-bank payment or the
condition for being regarded as via-bank payment, they will be neither entitled to the VAT rate of 0% and

--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 17 ---
the month they are permitted to pay tax by the credit method. For goods and services purchased before
that month, they are not entitled to input VAT credit.

1.3. Business establishments may not calculate and credit input VAT in the following cases: Value added
invoices are issued at variance with law provisions, i.e., they are not written with VAT (except for special
cases in which value added invoices may be written with VAT-inclusive payment prices); the seller's
name, address or tax identification number is not written or written incorrectly, making the seller
unidentifiable; VAT payment invoices and vouchers are fake; invoices are erased or improperly modified,
sham invoices (invoiced goods or services are not actually sold); invoices are written with a value not true
to the real value of goods or services purchased, sold or exchanged.

2. Method of calculation of VAT directly on the basis of added value
2.1. The method of tax calculation directly on the basis of added value applies to the following entities:

a/ Business individuals and households that fail to observe or inadequately observe the accounting,
invoice and document regime prescribed by law.

b/ Foreign organizations and individuals that conduct business in Vietnam not under the Investment Law
and fail to observe or inadequately observe the accounting, invoice and document regime prescribed by
law.

c/ Entities trading in gold, silver, gems and foreign currencies.

In case business establishments that pay VAT by the tax credit method are engaged in trading in and
fashioning gold, silver and gems, they shall separately account gold, silver and gem trading activities
subject to the method of tax calculation directly on the basis of added value.

2.2. Determination of payable VAT amounts:

The payable VAT amount by the method of tax calculation directly on the basis of value added is equal to
the added value of the taxable goods or service multiplied by (x) the VAT rate applicable to that goods or
service.

a/ The added value of a goods or service is equal to the payment price of the goods sold or the service
provided minus (-) the payment price of the corresponding goods or service purchased.

Payment price of a goods sold or service provided is the actual sale price stated in the goods or service
sale invoice, which is inclusive of VAT and surcharges enjoyable by the seller, regardless of whether the
money has been collected.

Payment price of a goods or service purchased is equal to the VAT-inclusive value of the purchased or
imported goods or service used for the production of or trading in the corresponding VAT-liable goods or
service sold.

For some business lines, the added value is determined as follows:

- For production and business activities, it is the difference between sale turnover and turnover of
purchased supplies, goods and services used in production and business. When business
establishments cannot account turnover of purchased supplies, goods and services corresponding to
turnover of sold goods, the added value shall be determined as follows:

The cost of goods sold is equal to (=) the turnover left at the beginning of the period plus (+) the purchase
turnover in the period minus (-) the turnover left at the end of the period.

Example 23: Establishment A produces wood articles. In a month, it sells 150 products and earns a total
sale turnover of VND 25 million.

The value of supplies and materials purchased from outside for the production of these 150 products is
VND 19 million, of which:

+ Principal raw material (timber): VND 14 million.
+ Other materials and services purchased from outside: VND 5 million.

The applicable VAT rate is 10%. The VAT amount payable by establishment A shall be calculated as
follows:

+ The added value of the sold products:

VND 25 million - VND 19 million = VND 6 million.
+ The payable VAT amount:

VND 6 million x 10% = VND 0.6 million.

- For construction and installation, it is the difference between amounts earned from the construction and
installation of works or work items minus (-) the cost of materials and supplies, cost of power,
transportation, services purchased from outside, and other expenses for the construction and installation
of works or work items.

- For transport activities, it is the difference between collected freight, loading and unloading charges
minus (-) the cost of petrol and oil, spare parts and other expenses for transportation activities.

- For food and drink catering activities, it is the difference between amounts earned from the sale of foods
and drinks, service charges and other revenues minus (-) prime costs of goods and services purchased
for the food and drink catering.


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 18 ---
- For trading in gold, silver, gems and foreign currencies, the value added is the difference between
turnover from the sale of gold, silver, gems or foreign currencies minus (-) prime costs of sold gold, silver,
gems or foreign currencies.

- For business establishments paying VAT calculated by the tax credit method and trading in gold, silver,
gems or foreign currencies subject to application of the method of tax calculation directly based on value
added, they shall separately account input VAT amounts for declaration of VAT amounts payable for
different goods and services subject to different tax calculation methods.

If they cannot separately account input VAT, the creditable input VAT amount shall be determined
according to the proportion of the turnover of goods and services subject to VAT calculated by the tax
credit method to the total turnover of goods sold in the period.

- For other business activities, it is the difference between amounts earned from business activities minus
(-) prime costs of goods and services purchased for the performance of such business activities.

- Business establishments paying VAT calculated directly on the basis of added value may not include
the value of assets purchased from outside, invested or constructed for use as fixed assets in the
turnover from purchased goods or services for the purpose of added value calculation.

b/ For business establishments that sell goods or provide services and have sufficient invoices for all
sales under regulations or satisfy all conditions for determining exact turnover from the sale of goods or
services under contracts and payment vouchers but have insufficient invoices on purchase of input goods
or services, the value added shall be determined to be equal to the turnover multiplied by (x) the ratio (%)
of the value added to the turnover.

The ratio (%) of the added value to turnover to serve as a basis for determining the value added is
specified as follows:

- Commercial activities (goods distribution and supply): 10%.
- Services and construction (except for construction with the contracted supply of materials): 50%.

- Production, transportation, services associated with the supply of goods, construction with the
contracted supply of materials: 30%.

c/ For business activities, individuals and households that fail to observe or inadequately observe the
accounting, invoice or voucher regime prescribed by law, VAT shall be paid according to a percentage
(%) prescribed by the Finance Ministry.

IV. GOODS AND SERVICE PURCHASE AND SALE INVOICES AND VOUCHERS

Business establishments, when purchasing or selling goods and services, shall abide by the regime on
invoices and vouchers as prescribed by law.

1. Business establishments paying VAT by the tax credit method, when selling goods or providing
services shall use value added invoices. When making invoices, business establishments shall fully and
correctly fill in all items on the invoices. A value added invoice must indicate the VAT-exclusive sale price,
charge and surcharge collected in addition to the sale price (if any), VAT and VAT-inclusive total payment
price. If the VAT-exclusive sale price is not indicated separately from VAT and only the payment price is
indicated, output VAT must be calculated on the basis of the payment price, except for cases in which
special vouchers are used.

Business establishments paying tax calculated directly on the basis of value added, when selling goods
or providing services, shall use sale invoices.

2. The use and writing of invoices and vouchers in some cases is specified as follows:

2.1. Production and business establishments paying VAT by the tax credit method, when selling goods or
services not liable to VAT selling goods and services to VAT-exempt entities; and selling gold, silver,
gems or foreign currencies, shall use value added invoices. On these value added invoices only the line
for writing the sale price is written with the VAT-exclusive price while the lines for writing the tax rate and
VAT amount are left blank and crossed out. In case of selling goods or services not liable to VAT or to
VAT-exempt entities, invoices must clearly state that goods are not liable to VAT or are sold to a VAT-
exempt entity.

2.2. For export and import business establishments paying VAT by the tax credit method which import
goods under other establishments’ consignment, when delivering the goods, they shall make vouchers as
follows:

If the import consignee, when delivering goods imported under consignment, has paid VAT at the
importation stage, it shall make a value added invoice for use by the import consignor as a basis for
declaration and credit of input VAT on goods imported under consignment. When the import consignee
does not pay VAT at the importation stage, when delivering imported goods, it shall fill in an ex-
warehousing-cum-internal transport bill enclosed with an internal transfer order under regulations for use
as a voucher for circulation of the goods on the market. Only after paying VAT at the importation stage for
goods imported under consignment can the establishment make an invoice according to this provision.

A value added invoice on delivery of goods imported under consignment must indicate:

a/ The VAT-exclusive sale price covering the value of goods actually imported at CIF price, import duty,
excise tax and other amounts payable according to regulations at the importation stage (if any).

b/ The VAT rate and VAT amount according to the VAT amount already paid at the importation stage.

c/ The total payment amount (= a + b).


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 19 ---
The import consignee shall issue a separate value added invoice for the commission paid for the
consigned import.

2.3. Production and business establishments (including export processing ones) which pay VAT by the
tax credit method and export VAT liable goods, when exporting goods, shall use value added invoices.

When delivering goods for transport to border gates or places where export procedures are carried out, if
having no ground to issue a value added invoice, the establishment shall use an ex-warehousing-cum-
internal transport together with an internal transfer order for use as a voucher for circulation of the goods
on the market. After completing the procedures for exporting goods, the establishment shall issue a value
added invoice for exported goods.

In case of export of goods under consignment (including export of processed goods under other
establishments’ consignment), when delivering goods to the export consignee, the consignor shall use an
ex-warehousing-cum-internal transport bill. After the goods are actually exported as certified by the
customs office, basing itself on the export consignee’ voucher for comparison and certification of the
quantity and value of the actually exported goods, the export consignor shall issue a value added invoice
for VAT payment and refund declaration. In this case, the export business establishment shall keep the
second original. If the export business establishment has registered with the tax office for printing and
circulating by itself invoices which will be used for exported goods and issued to foreign customers, it
shall use those invoices for tax declaration, payment and refund.

2.4. Use of invoices and vouchers for goods and services used for sales promotion or advertisement,
samples goods, or donated, presented as gifts or internally consumed:

a/ For goods and services used for sales promotion or advertisement, samples goods for goods
production and trading or service provision (products, goods and services used for sales promotion,
advertisement or sample goods are specified by the commercial law on trade promotion activities),
business establishments shall issue value added invoices clearly indicating the names and quantities of
goods and that these goods are used free of charge for sales promotion, advertisement or sample goods,
leaving the VAT rate line blank and crossed out.

b/ For goods and services used for donation or presentation as gifts, barter or wage payment to laborers
or for internal consumption, business establishments shall issue to customers value added invoices (or
sale invoices) with all items filled in, including the calculated VAT amount, like sale invoices.

Establishments using goods and services for internal consumption rather than for their production or
business, such as transportation, aviation, railway, post and telecommunications, on which output VAT is
not required to be calculated, must issue specific regulations on eligible beneficiaries and limit quantities
of goods or services for internal consumption, which are approved in writing by competent authorities.

2.5. For goods and services sold at reduced prices which are stated on their invoices, these invoices
must clearly state the reduced prices, VAT and VAT-inclusive total payment price.

If the price reduction is based on the quantity or sales turnover of the actually purchased goods or
service, which must reach a certain level, the reduced sum of money for the sold goods shall be adjusted
on the sale invoice of goods or service of the last purchase or those in the next period. This invoice must
show its serial number and the reduced sum of money.

2.6. For production and business establishments which deliver and transfer goods to their dependent
cost-accounting affiliates such as branches and shops in other localities (provinces or centrally run cities)
for sale or transfer among branches and affiliates; or which deliver goods to commission agents for sale
at fixed prices, basing themselves on the mode of business organization and cost-accounting, they may
opt for either of the following two ways of using invoices and vouchers:

a/ Using value added invoices as a basis for VAT declaration and payment in each unit and at each
independent stage;

b/ Using ex-warehousing-cum-internal transport bills together with the internal transfer orders for goods
internally transferred; using the delivery bills for goods consigned to sale agents under regulations,
together with the internal transfer orders.

Dependent cost-accounting affiliates, branches, shops and establishments acting as sale agents, when
selling goods, shall issue invoices as prescribed to purchasers, and at the same time make a list of goods
sold and send it to establishments which have transferred or delivered the goods or consigned goods for
agency sale (commonly referred to as goods-delivering establishments) so that these establishments can
issue value added invoices for actually sold goods, then hand them to dependent cost-accounting
affiliates, branches, shops and establishments acting as sale agents.

For establishments with a large sale volume and turnover, such a list may be made every 5 or 10 days.
When goods sold are subject to different VAT rates, different lists must be made for sold goods subject to
each VAT rate.

Dependent cost-accounting affiliates, branches, shops and establishments acting as sale agents shall
make VAT declaration and payment for goods volumes delivered for sale to purchasers and may make
input VAT declaration and credit according to value added invoices of goods-delivering establishments.

2.7. Business establishments acting as goods collection and purchase agents in various forms, when
delivering goods to the collection and purchase-consigning establishments, shall issue invoices for goods
they collect and purchase and for commissions they enjoy (if any).

2.8. When business establishments purchase goods for which sellers have issued invoices and which the
business establishments have received, if the business establishments return part or the whole of these
goods after detecting that they are of wrong specifications or poor quality, before returning such goods to


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 20 ---
the sellers, they shall issue invoices clearly stating that the goods are returned to the sellers due to wrong
specifications or poor quality, and the VAT amount. These invoices serve as a basis for the seller to
adjust the sales turnover and output VAT amount and the purchaser to adjust the purchase value and
input VAT amount.

When the purchaser has no invoices, upon the return of goods, the purchaser and seller shall make a
written record or written agreement clearly stating the type, quantity and value of the returned goods
calculated according to the VAT-exclusive price and VAT amount written on the sale invoice (serial
number and date of the invoice), the reason for the return of goods together with the invoice to the seller.
This written record shall be kept together with the sale invoice for use as a basis to adjust the seller's
declared sale turnover and VAT amounts.

When the seller has delivered goods and issued an invoice while the purchaser has not yet received the
goods but, after detecting that goods are of wrong specifications or poor quality, the purchaser returns
part or the whole of the goods, upon return of the goods, the purchaser and the seller shall make a
written record clearly stating the type, quantity, the VAT-exclusive value and VAT amount of the returned
goods as stated on the sale invoice (serial number, sign and date of the invoice). The goods shall be
returned to the seller together with the invoice so that the latter can re-issue a value added invoice for the
received goods and use it as a basis for the seller to adjust the sales turnover and output VAT amount.

2.9. When a business establishment has sold or supplied goods or services and issued an invoice but
then has adjusted the sale price (up or down) because its goods or services are of poor quality or wrong
specifications, the seller and purchaser shall make a written record thereof or a written agreement clearly
stating the quantity and specifications of the goods, the level of price increase (decrease) as indicated on
the sale invoice (serial number and date of the invoice and time), the reason for price increase
(decrease), and at the same time the seller shall issue an invoice with an adjusted price. That invoice
must indicate the adjusted (increased or decreased) sale price (without any negative (-) figures), VAT
amount for goods or services on invoice No....sign.... Basing themselves on the invoice with the adjusted
price, the seller and purchaser shall declare their adjusted purchase and sale turnovers, output and input
VAT amounts. In case the tax rate indicated on the sale invoice is higher than the prescribed tax rate, if
the purchaser is unidentifiable, no invoice with an adjusted VAT amount will be issued.

2.10. Business establishments which deliver goods for mobile sale shall use ex-warehousing-cum-
internal transport bills together with internal transfer orders under regulations and, when selling goods,
issue invoices as prescribed.

2.11. Business establishments which directly retail goods or provide services of a value below the
prescribed level are not required to issue invoices; if a purchaser requests an invoice, they shall issue an
invoice as prescribed. When they do not issue any invoices, they shall make retail lists. At the end of a
day, they shall base themselves on retail lists to issue invoices for use as a tax calculation basis.

2.12. For construction establishments having construction and installation projects which are executed for
a long time and for which payment is made according to the implementation progress or completed and
taken-over work volume, they shall issue invoices of payment for the completed and taken-over
construction volume. Value added invoices must indicate the VAT-exclusive turnover and VAT amount.
When construction works have been completed and invoices of payment for the work value have been
issued but the payable value of the construction volume is reduced in the process of approving the
settlement of the value of capital construction works, invoices and vouchers for the adjusted payable
construction value shall be issued.

2.13. For business establishments which are allocated or leased land by the State for building houses for
sale or lease or infrastructure for sale or lease, for transportation services with turnover from international
transportation; and international tour services, invoices shall be issued with the following details:

a/ The line for the sale price shall be written with the VAT-exclusive sale price of the house or
infrastructure (the house sale price and the land price or rent rate or infrastructure rent rate are written
separately), transportation or package tour service turnover.

b/ The line for the taxable price being the price determined under Point 1.8, Section |, Part B of this
Circular; transportation or tourist service turnover minus expenses arising overseas such as those for
meals, accommodation and travel.

c/ The lines for the VAT rate and amount and the payment price shall be written as prescribed.

If a business establishment dealing in real estate, building infrastructure or houses for sale or transfer
collects money from purchasers according to project implementation or money collection schedules
stated in contracts, upon collecting money, it shall issue value added invoices. Such an invoice must
indicate the collected sum of money, land price to be subtracted from VAT calculation turnover, VAT rate
and VAT amount. To-be-subtracted land price shall be calculated according to the ratio (%) of the sum of
money collected according to the project implementation or money collection schedule stated in the
contract, to that to be subtracted at the time of transfer (the time of first money collection according to
progress or schedule).

2.14. Financial leasing establishments which lease VAT-liable assets shall issue invoices as prescribed.

Financial leasing establishments, when leasing assets liable to VAT, shall issue value added invoices (for
assets purchased at home) or vouchers of VAT payment at the importation stage (for imported assets).

only credit input VAT on the assets not yet fully collected.

In case the lessor and the lessee jointly pool capital lor the purchase of the assets and the lessor only
collects the rent (principal and interest) corresponding to its contributed capital amount, the invoice on the
purchase of the assets for lease shall be managed by the lessor until the asset ownership is transferred
to the lessee. The VAT amount corresponding to the capital amount contributed by the lessor shall be
included in the first-time receipt.

In case a financial leasing contract has been completed, the VAT amount has been fully paid by the

C. VAT REFUND
Taxpayers entitled to and cases of VAT refund are specified as follows:

1. Business establishments that pay tax by the tax credit method may be considered for tax refund if they
have input tax amounts not fully credited for three or more consecutive months.

The refundable tax amount is the input tax amount not yet fully credited by the time of request for tax
refund.

Example 24: Enterprise A declares input and output VAT amounts as follows:
(Unit of calculation: VND million)

Tax declaration Input tax Output tax arising Payable | Accumulative input
month creditable in the in the month tax tax amount not yet
month credited
December 2008 200 100 -100 -100
January 2009 300 350 +50 -50
February 2009 300 200 -100 -150

In the above example, enterprise A has an accumulative input tax amount for three consecutive months
larger than the output VAT amount. Enterprise A is entitled to a VAT refund of VND 150 million.

2. For business establishments that have been newly founded under investment projects and made
business registration and registered to pay VAT by the tax credit method, or under oil and gas field
exploration and development projects which are still at the investment stage and have not yet started
operating, if the investment duration has lasted for one year or more, they may be entitled to VAT for
goods and services used for investment in every year. If the accumulated VAT amount on purchased
goods and services used for investment is VND 200 million or more, the establishments will be entitled to
VAT refund.

3. For operating business establishments that pay VAT by the tax credit method, if they have new
investment projects which are still at the investment stage, they shall make declarations for clearing VAT
amounts on purchased goods and services used for new investment projects against VAT amounts on
production and business activities they are conducting. After clearing, any uncredited VAT amount of
VND 200 million or more on purchased goods and services used for investment will be refunded for
investment projects.

For operating business establishments (except for enterprises applying accounting within the whole
system) that pay VAT by the tax credit method, if they have investment projects on new production
facilities in provinces or centrally run cities other than those in which they are headquartered, which are
still at the investment stage, have neither commenced operation nor made business or tax registration,
and have VAT amounts of VND 200 million or more on purchased goods and services used for
investment, these VAT amounts will be refunded for investment projects. In these cases, business
establishments shall make separate tax declarations and refund dossiers.

4. If in a month, a business establishment exports goods or services and has an uncredited input VAT
amount of VND 200 million or more on exported goods in that month, the business establishment will be
considered for VAT refund on a monthly basis. If in a month, a business establishment both exports and
domestically sells goods or services and has an uncredited input VAT amount of VND 200 million or more
on exported goods or services in that month, even after being cleared against the output VAT on
domestically sold goods or services, the business establishment will be considered for VAT refund on a
monthly basis. If after being cleared against the output VAT on domestically sold goods or services, its
uncredited input VAT amount is less than VND 200 million, it will not be considered for VAT refund.

Entities entitled to VAT refund in some cases of export include establishments consigning their goods for
export, in case of export consignment; establishments undertaking to process export goods and entering

into contracts directly with foreign parties, in case of entrusted export processing; establishments entering
into export processing contracts with foreign parties, in case of intermediary processing; and enterprises
having their goods and supplies exported for overseas construction works, in case of goods exported for
overseas construction works.

5. Business establishments shall finalize tax upon their division, splitting, dissolution, bankruptcy,
ownership transformation; or assignment, sale, contracting or lease, for State enterprises, when they
have input VAT amounts not yet fully credited or any overpaid VAT amounts.

6. Refund of paid VAT amounts for programs and projects funded with non-refundable official
development assistance (ODA) or non-refundable or humanitarian aid:

6.1. For projects funded with non-refundable ODA: Program or project owners or principal contractors or
organizations designated by foreign parties to manage programs or projects will be entitled to refund of
VAT amounts paid for goods and services purchased in Vietnam for use for these programs and projects.

6.2. Vietnamese organizations that use humanitarian aid money of foreign organizations or individuals to
purchase goods and services for programs or projects funded with non- refundable or humanitarian aid in
Vietnam will be entitled to refund of VAT amounts paid for these goods and services.

Example 25: The Red Cross Society is provided with VND 200 million as aid from international
organizations to purchase humanitarian aid goods for inhabitants in the provinces hit by natural disasters.
The VAT-exclusive value of purchased goods is VND 200 million and the VAT amount is VND 20 million.
The Red Cross Society will be refunded a tax amount of VND 20 million.

The refund of paid VAT amounts for non-refundable ODA-funded programs and projects complies with

8 of this Part must be those paying VAT by the credit method, possessing business registration
certificates or investment licenses (practice licenses), having seals required by law, keeping accounting
books and documents under the accounting law; and having deposit bank accounts with their tax
identification numbers.

In case business establishments have made tax refund application dossiers, input VAT amounts
requested to be refunded must not be cleared against creditable VAT amounts of the month following the
month of making refund dossiers.

D. PLACES OF TAX PAYMENT

Taxpayers shall make VAT declaration and payment in localities where they conduct production or
business. The VAT declaration and payment comply with the Tax Administration Law and guiding
documents.

In some specific cases, the VAT declaration and payment and procedures for transfer of vouchers are
guided as follows:

1. Taxpayers that declare and pay VAT by the credit method and have dependant accounting production
establishments (including also processing and assembling establishments) located in provinces or
centrally run cities other than those where they are headquartered shall pay VAT both in localities where
their production establishments are located and localities where they are headquartered.

Dependent accounting production establishments that conduct cost-accounting activities shall register for
tax payment by the credit method in localities where they conduct production activities and use value
added invoices as a basis for tax declaration and payment in these localities when delivering their semi-
finished or finished products to other establishments, including their headquarters.

In case dependant production establishments fail to conduct cost-accounting activities, taxpayers at
headquarters shall pay VAT equal to 2% (for goods subject to the VAT rate of 10%) or 1 % (for goods
subject to the VAT rate of 5%) of VAT-exclusive turnover of products they produce or products of the
same category in localities where they are located. VAT amounts already paid by taxpayers for their
dependent accounting production establishments will be cleared against their payable VAT amounts in
localities where they are headquartered.

Example 26: Enterprise A is headquartered in Ho Chi Minh City and has a dependent accounting
production establishment in Ba Ria - Vung Tau producing products subject to the VAT rate of 10%. These
products are sold by Enterprise A. As a result, Enterprise A shall make declare and pay on behalf of its
dependent accounting establishment a monthly VAT amount equal to 2% of the turnover calculated at the
VAT-exclusive sale price of goods produced by its dependent accounting production establishment in Ba
Ria - Vung Tau. VAT amounts paid for the dependent accounting establishment may be cleared against
Enterprise A’s payable amounts.

2. Procedures for transfer of vouchers between the State Treasury and tax offices

Taxpayers shall pay VAT amounts arising in localities where they are headquartered to the State
Treasury offices of the same level with tax offices to which they have made tax registration and
declaration, and concurrently pay VAT according to prescribed percentages (%) for their affiliated
production establishments located in provinces or centrally run cities other than those where they are

headquartered. Tax payment vouchers shall be made for each State Treasury office, clearly indicating
state budget revenue accounts of localities in which budget revenues arise.

In case taxpayers pay tax in cash at State Treasury offices in localities where they are headquartered,

Treasury offices for accounting tax amounts of dependent accounting production establishments as state
budget revenues.
