beans from coffee farmers, and later sells such coffee beans to business household H. In this
case, the turnover of company A from the sale of coffee beans to household H is subject to
the VAT rate of 5%.

Example 21: Mr. X's household that sells tea purchased from tea farmers to Mr. Y’s
household shall calculate and pay VAT at the rate of 1% of the turnover from the sale of tea
leaves to Mr. Y’s household.

In case value-added invoices and VAT declaration and calculation have been made for
unprocessed or preliminarily processed cultivation, husbandry or aquatic products sold to
enterprises and cooperatives, the sellers and purchasers shall modify such invoices in order
to be exempted from VAT declaration, calculation and payment as guided in this Clause.

6. In case a fixed asset currently in use for which depreciation has been made according to its
book value is transferred between a business establishment and a member unit in which the
business establishment owns 100% of capital or between member units wholly owned by a
business establishment to serve the production or provision of VAT-liable products or
services, value-added invoices and VAT declaration and payment are not required. The
business establishment having such asset shall make an asset transfer decision or order,
enclosed with a dossier on the origin of the asset.

In case an asset has been re-valuated before transfer or is transferred to an establishment
producing or providing goods or services not liable to VAT, a value-added invoice must be
issued and declare and pay VAT declaration and payment must be made according to
regulations.

Chapter Il
TAX BASES AND TAX CALCULATION METHODS
Section 1. TAX BASES
Article 6. Tax bases
The bases for VAT calculation are taxed price and tax rate.
Article 7. Taxed price

1. For goods and services sold by production and business establishments, the taxed price is
the selling price exclusive of VAT. For excise tax-liable goods and services, the taxed price is
the selling price inclusive of excise tax but exclusive of VAT.

For environmental protection tax-liable goods, the taxed price is the selling price inclusive of
environmental protection tax but exclusive of VAT; for goods and services liable to both
excise tax and environmental protection tax, the taxed price is the selling price inclusive of
excise tax and environmental protection tax but exclusive of VAT.

2. For imports, the taxed price is the import price at border gate plus (+) import duty (if any),
plus (+) excise tax (if any) and plus (+) environmental protection tax (if any). The import price
at border gate shall be determined under regulations on taxed prices of imports.

For goods eligible for import duty exemption or reduction, the taxed price is the import price
plus (+) the import duty determined at the payable duty rate after subtracting the exempted or
reduced amount.

3. For products, goods and services (including those purchased from outside or produced by
business establishments themselves) which are used for barter, presentation as gifts,
donation or payment of salaries, the taxed price is that of goods or services of the same or
similar type at the time of carrying out such activity.

Example 22: Establishment A, an electric fan manufacturer, barters 50 fans with
establishment B for iron and steel. The selling price (exclusive of VAT) of a fan is VND
400,000. In this case, the taxed price is 50 x VND 400,000 = VND 20,000,000.


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 12 ---
Particularly for letters of invitation (specifying free admission) to art performances, fashion
shows, beauty and model contests or sports competitions permitted by competent state
agencies under law, the taxed price is zero (0). Before art performances or sports
competitions take place, art performance organizers shall determine and take responsibility
for the quantity of letters of invitation and the list of invited organizations and individuals.
Establishments that fraudulently collect money for letters of invitation shall be handled in
accordance with the law on tax administration.

Example 23: Joint-stock company X is licensed by a competent agency to organize the “Miss
Vietnam 20xx” contest. In addition to the quantity of tickets printed for sale to the public, the
company prints a certain quantity of letters of invitation for free presentation and has a list of
invited guests. When declaring VAT, the taxed price of such letters of invitation is zero (0). If
tax agencies detect that company X collects money for such letters of invitation, company X
shall be handled in accordance with the law on tax administration.

4. Taxed prices of products, goods and services for internal consumption

For a product, goods or service delivered or provided by a business establishment for
consumption to serve its business activities (internal consumption), the taxed price is that of
the product, goods or service of the same or similar type at the time of consumption. The
business establishment may declare and credit VAT amounts with regard to added-value
invoices issued for products, goods or services delivered for internal consumption to serve the
production or provision of VAT-liable goods or services.

For goods which are transferred within a production and business establishment such as
goods transferred within the establishment's warehousing system or ex-warehoused as
supplies or semi-finished products for further manufacture, VAT calculation and payment are
not required.

In case a business establishment manufactures or builds its fixed assets by itself (self-made
fixed assets) for the production or provision of VAT- liable goods or services, upon
completion, takeover test and handover, the business establishment is not required to make
invoices. The input VAT on the creation of the self-made fixed assets shall be declared and
credited under regulations.

For products, goods and services delivered by a business establishment for the production or
provision of goods or services not liable to VAT, the taxed price is the selling price of
products, goods and services of the same or similar type at the time of consumption of such
products, goods and services.

Example 24: Unit A, an electric fan manufacturer, installs 50 fans, which are its products, in its
production workshops. The selling price (exclusive of VAT) of a fan of this kind is VND
1,000,000 and the applicable VAT rate is 10%.

The taxed price is VND 1,000,000 x 50 = VND 50,000,000.

Unit A shall issue an added-value invoice indicating the taxed price of VND 50,000,000 and
the VAT amount of VND 5,000,000. Unit A may declare and credit VAT for this invoice.

Example 25: Company Y, a bottled drinking water producer, sells a water bottle at the VAT-
exclusive market price of VND 4,000. When Company Y delivers 300 water bottles for an
excursion of its employees’ relatives, it shall declare and calculate VAT for these 300 bottles
delivered not for production and business activities at the taxed price of VND 4,000 x 300 =
VND 1,200,000.

Example 26: Garment producer B has a yarn workshop and a sewing workshop. If producer B
transfers finished yarn from the yarn workshop to the sewing workshop for further use in the
production process, it is not required to calculate and pay VAT for the quantity of yarn
delivered to the sewing workshop.

Example 27: Joint-stock company AP purchases materials for the production of animal feed
and has declared and credited input VAT upon such purchase. Part of the produced animal
feed is sold to the market and the rest is used for animal-rearing activities of the company.
When delivering feed for its animal-rearing activities, company AP shall make invoices and
declare and pay VAT for the delivered quantity of feed and does not declare and credit input
VAT with regard to added-value invoices indicating the quantity of feed delivered for animal-


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 13 ---
rearing activities.

Example 28: Joint-stock company P builds by itself houses for workers’ mid-shift breaks
within its production and business premises and has no attached unit, team or group carrying
out such building. Upon completion and takeover of these houses, company P is not required
to make invoices. The input VAT on the building of these houses shall be declared and
credited under regulations.

Particularly, business establishments that use internally consumed goods and services for
production and business activities for which output VAT calculation is not required, such as
transportation, aviation, railway, post and telecommunications, shall issue a document to
specify internally consumed goods and services and their consumption limits according to
regulations.

5. For products, goods and services used for sales promotion in accordance with the
commercial law, the taxed price is zero (0). For goods and services used for sales promotion
in contravention with the commercial law, VAT declaration, calculation and payment are the
same as those for goods and services used for internal consumption, presentation as gifts or
donation.

Below are some specific forms of sales promotion:

a/ For sales promotion in the form of free provision of sample goods or services for
customers’ trial use, presentation of goods as gifts to customers or free provision of services,
the taxed price of sample goods and services is zero (0).

Example 29: Limited liability company P is a soft drink producer. In 2014, the company offers
two drives of sales promotion in May and December in the form of “buy 10 get 1 free”. The
sales promotion program in May is implemented according to the order and procedures
prescribed in the commercial law. Accordingly, for the products given free to buyers in May,
the company may apply the taxed price of zero (0).

In case the sales promotion program in December is implemented at variance with the order
and procedures prescribed in the commercial law, company P shall declare and pay VAT for
the quantity of the products given free to buyers in December.

b/ For the form of sale of goods or provision of services at prices lower than the previous
goods sale or service provision prices, the taxed price is the reduced price applied during the
registered or notified period of sales promotion.

Example 30: Telecommunications company N sells prepaid cards for mobile phones. The
company registers sales promotion in accordance with the commercial law in the form of
selling cards at reduced prices from April 1, 2014, through April 20, 2014. Accordingly, a
prepaid card with the face value of VND 100,000 (inclusive of VAT) is sold for VND 90,000 in
the sales promotion period.

The taxed price of a prepaid card with the face value of VND 100,000 in the sales promotion
period is:

c/ For sales promotion in the form of sale of goods or provision of services accompanied with
vouchers, VAT declaration and calculation are not required for these vouchers.

6. For lease of property such as houses, offices, workshops, warehouses, wharves, yards,
means of transport, machinery or equipment, the taxed price is the VAT-exclusive rent
amount.

In case the rent is paid in installments or prepaid for a lease term, the taxed price is the rent
paid in installments or prepaid for the lease term, exclusive of VAT.

Applicable rent rates must be agreed upon by involved parties in their contracts. When a rent
rate bracket is prescribed by law, rent rates must be within that bracket.

7. For goods sold on installment or deferred payment, the taxed price is the lump-sum VAT-
exclusive selling price, excluding interests on installment or deferred payment.

Example 31: A motorbike trading company sells 100-cc motorbikes of X brand. The VAT-


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 14 ---
exclusive selling price of a motorbike is VND 25.5 million (of which the selling price is VND 25
million and the installment interest is VND 0.5 million). In this case, the taxed price is VND 25
million.

8. For goods processing, the taxed price is the VAT-exclusive processing price under the
processing contract, consisting of remuneration, costs of fuel, power, auxiliary materials and
other expenses for the processing.

9. For construction and installation, the taxed price is the VAT- exclusive value of the
completed and taken-over work, work item or job.

a/ For cases of construction and installation involving contracted supply of materials, the
taxed price is the construction and installation price, inclusive of the VAT-exclusive value of
materials.

Example 32: Construction company B enters into a work construction contract, covering the
value of construction materials. The VAT-exclusive total payment value is VND 1.5 billion, of
which the VAT-exclusive value of construction materials is VND 1 billion, then the taxed price
is VND 1.5 billion.

b/ For cases of construction and installation without contracted supply of materials, machinery
or equipment, the taxed price is the construction and installation value not including the VAT-
exclusive value of materials, machinery or equipment.

Example 33: Construction company B enters into a construction contract not covering the
value of construction materials. If the total VAT- exclusive value of the constructed work is
VND 1.5 billion and the VAT- exclusive value of construction materials supplied by investor A
is VND 1 billion, then the taxed price in this case is VND 0.5 billion (VND 1.5 billion - VND 1
billion).

c/ For cases of construction and installation with payments made based on each completed
and taken-over work item or on the value of the completed and taken-over construction and
installation volume, the taxed price is the VAT-exclusive value of the completed and taken-
over work item or work volume.

Example 34: Textile company X (party A) hires construction company Y (party B) to perform
construction and installation work to expand a production workshop.

The total VAT-exclusive value of the work is VND 200 billion, including:
- Construction and installation value: VND 80 billion

- Value of equipment supplied and installed by party B: VND 120 billion
- VAT amount at 10%: VND 20 billion {= (80 + 120) x 10%}

- Total amount payable by party A: VND 220 billion

- Party A shall:

+ Take over the workshop, account it as an increase of VND 200 billion (VAT-exclusive value)
in the value of its fixed assets for depreciation calculation.

+ Declare and credit the VAT amount of VND 20 billion against the output VAT on goods sold,
or request tax refund under regulations.

If party A tests and takes over the work and accepts to make payment to party B per work
item (presuming that a VND 80 billion-construction and installation volume is tested, taken
over and paid for first), then the taxed price is VND 80 billion.

10. For real estate transfer, the taxed price is the real estate transfer price minus (-) the land
price to be subtracted upon VAT calculation.

a/ The land price to be subtracted upon VAT calculation is specified as follows:

a.1/ For land allocated by the State for building infrastructure or houses for sale, the land
price to be subtracted upon VAT calculation includes the land use levy payable into the state
budget (exclusive of the exempted or reduced land use levy amount) and expense for
compensation and ground clearance as prescribed by law.


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 15 ---
Example 35: In 2014, real estate company A is allocated land by the State to build
infrastructure and houses for sale. The payable land use levy (exclusive of the exempted or
reduced land use levy amount and expense for compensation and ground clearance under
the approved plan) is VND 30 billion. The project is entitled to a 20% reduction of the payable
land use levy amount. The expense for compensation and ground clearance under the
approved plan is VND 15 billion.

The total subtracted value of land shall be determined as follows:
- Exempted or reduced land use levy amount: VND 30 billion x 20% = VND 6 billion;

- Land use levy amount payable into the state budget (exclusive of the exempted or reduced
land use levy amount): VND 30 billion - 6 billion - 15 billion = 9 billion;

- Total land price to be subtracted upon VAT calculation, inclusive of the land use levy
payable into the state budget (exclusive of the exempted or reduced land use levy amount)
and the expense for compensation and ground clearance: VND 9 billion + 15 billion = 24
billion. The total land price to be subtracted shall be allocated to the number of square meters.
of land allowed for trading.

a.2/ In case of auctioning land use rights, the land price to be subtracted upon VAT
calculation is the successful bid;

a.3/ In case of renting land to build infrastructure for lease or to build houses for sale, the land
price to be subtracted upon VAT calculation is the land rental payable into the state budget
(exclusive of the exempted or reduced land rent amount) plus the expense for compensation
and ground clearance as prescribed by law. From July 1, 2014, the rent of land to build
houses for sale must comply with the 2013 Land Law.

Example 36: Joint-stock company VN-KR invests in building and commercially operating
industrial production and service infrastructure facilities. The company is leased a land area of
300,000 m2 for 50 years by the State with a lump-sum land rent for building industrial park
infrastructure for project implementation. The lump-sum land rent rate for the whole lease
duration is VND 82,000/m2. The total payable land rent amount is VND 24.6 billion. The
company is not entitled to land rent exemption or reduction. After building infrastructure, the
company signs a contract to sublease a land area of 16,500 m2 to another investor for 30
years at the VAT-inclusive rent rate of VND 650,000/m2 for the whole lease duration.

The VAT-inclusive price from the lease of infrastructure in the whole lease duration (30 years)
by joint-stock company VN-KR to another investor is:

VND 16,500 m2 x (650,000 - (VND 82,000/m2 : 50 years x 30 years)) = VND 9.9132 billion.
The VAT-exclusive rent is:

= VND 9.012 billion.
The VAT amount is: 9.012 x 10% = VND 0.9012 billion.

a.4/ In case a business establishment receives land use rights transferred from an
organization or individual, the land price to be subtracted upon VAT calculation is the land
price at the time of transfer, inclusive of the value of infrastructure (if any). The business
establishment may not declare and credit input VAT of infrastructure already included in the
non-taxable subtracted value of land use rights.

If the to-be-subtracted land price is exclusive of the value of infrastructure, the business
establishment may declare and credit input VAT of infrastructure not yet included in the non-
taxable subtracted value of land use rights

If the land price at the time of transfer cannot be determined, the land price to be subtracted
upon VAT calculation is the land price set by the provincial-level People’s Committee at the
time of signing the transfer contract.

Example 37: In August 2013, company A acquires (purchases) the right to use a land plot of
200 m2 transferred from individual B in Binh An residential area in province X at the price of
VND 6 billion. Company A has signed a land use right transfer contract and has it notarized in
accordance with the land law and has sufficient documents proving the payment of VND 6
billion to individual B. Company A has built no work in this land plot. In October 2014,


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 16 ---
company A transfers (resells) the above land plot at the price of VND 9 billion, then it shall
make an added-value invoice and declare and pay VAT; the land price to be subtracted in the
taxed price is the land price at the time of transfer (VND 6 billion).

Example 38: In November 2013, limited-liability company A acquires the right to use a land
plot of 300 m2 with workshops already built on this land plot from individual B at the price of
VND 10 billion without documents proving the land price at the time of transfer. In April 2014,
company A transfers this land plot with workshops at the price of VND 14 billion, then the land
price to be subtracted upon VAT calculation is the land price set by the provincial-level
People’s Committee at the time of transfer (November 2013).

Example 39:

In September 2013, company B purchases from real estate trading company A a 2,000-m2
land plot with infrastructure at a total price of VND

62 billion (of which the land price not liable to VAT is VND 40 billion, at a price of VND 20
million/m2).

Company A shall write in the invoice:

- VAT-exclusive transfer price: VND 60 billion

- Land price not liable to VAT: VND 40 billion

- VAT on infrastructure: VND 2 billion

- Total price: VND 62 billion

Company A shall declare the payable VAT amount as follows:

Payable VAT amount = Output VAT amount - Creditable input VAT amount

Supposing that the VND 1.5 billion amount of input VAT on infrastructure construction is
eligible for credit, then:

Payable VAT amount = VND 2 billion - VND 1.5 billion = VND 0.5 billion

Company B then builds infrastructure and 10 villas (each with a floor area of 200 m2) for sale.
The total input VAT amount for construction of these villas is VND 3 billion.

On April 1, 2015, Company B signs a contract to sell one villa to customer C for VND 10
billion, exclusive of VAT. The land price to be subtracted when determining the taxed price of
the sold villa is:

- The value of land use rights (exclusive of the value of infrastructure) for the villa at the time
of acquiring land use rights from company A is: VND 20 million x 200 m2 = VND 4 billion.

- The value of infrastructure allocated for a villa is: (VND 20 billion : 2,000 m2) x 200 m2 =
VND 2 billion

- The value of land use rights (inclusive of the value of infrastructure) at the time of acquiring
land use rights from company A to be subtracted when determining the taxed price of the sold
villa is VND 6 billion.

Company B shall write in the invoice:

- Transfer price of one villa: VND 10 billion

- Land price not liable to VAT to be subtracted: VND 6 billion

- VAT amount: VND 0.4 billion [(VND 10 billion - VND 6 billion) x 10%]
- Total price: VND 10.4 billion

Supposing that company B sells out all 10 villas in the month. It shall declare and pay VAT as
follows: The payable VAT amount = output VAT amount - creditable input VAT amount = VND
0.4 billion x 10 villas — VND 3 billion = VND 1 billion.

The VND 2 billion-VAT amount for the value of infrastructure written in the invoice on the
acquisition of land use rights from company A is not allowed for declaration and credit.

In case company B determines that the value of land use rights exclusive of the value of


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 17 ---
infrastructure at the time of acquiring land use rights from company A to be subtracted when
determining the taxed price of one villa sold is VND 4 billion, it shall write in the invoice:

- Transfer price of one villa: VND 10 billion

- Land price not liable to VAT to be subtracted: VND 4 billion

- VAT amount: VND 0.6 billion [(VND 10 billion - VND 4 billion) x 10%]
- Total price: VND 10.6 billion

Supposing that in April 2015, company B sells out all 10 villas. It shall declare and pay VAT
as follows: Payable VAT amount = output VAT amount - creditable input VAT amount
(including input VAT amount for villa construction and input VAT amount for the value of
infrastructure) = VND 0.6 billion x 10 villas - VND 3 billion - VND 2 billion (input VAT amount
for infrastructure) = VND 1 billion.

a.5/ In case real estate businesses apply the form of build-transfer (BT) and make payment
with land use rights, the land price to be subtracted upon VAT calculation is the price set
under law at the time of signing BT contracts. At the time of signing BT contracts, if the land
price cannot be determined, the to-be-subtracted land price is the payment price of the
constructed work as decided by the provincial-level People’s Committee in accordance with
law.

Example 40: Joint-stock company P signs a BT contract with the People’s Committee of
province A on the construction of a bridge in exchange for land. The work payment value
determined by the People’s Committee of province A at the time of contract signing is VND 2
trillion; in exchange, company P is allocated by the People’s Committee of province A 500 ha
of land for building houses for sale, then the land value to be subtracted upon VAT calculation
is VND 2 trillion.

a.6/ In case real estate businesses acquire agricultural land use rights from people under
transfer contracts, then they are allowed by competent state agencies to convert such land
into residential land for building condominiums or houses for sale, the land value to be
subtracted upon VAT calculation is the price of the transferred agricultural land and other
expenses including land use levy paid into the state budget for land conversion and personal
income tax paid on behalf of land transferors (if the parties agree that real estate businesses
pay land use levy on behalf of land transferors).

a.7/ In case of building multi-story houses for many households or condominiums for sale, the
to-be-subtracted land price per 1m2 of housing equals the land price to be subtracted under
Points a.1 thru a.6 above divided by (:) the number of square meters of the floor area,
excluding the area under common use such as corridor, staircase, basement and
underground construction works.

b/ In case of infrastructure construction and commercial operation, or construction of houses
for sale, transfer or lease, the taxed price is the sum earned according to the project
implementation schedule or payment schedule indicated in the contract minus (-) the land
price to be subtracted in proportion to the percentage of the collected amount to the total
contractual value.

11. For goods and service sale and purchase agency and brokerage activities, and
remunerated or commissioned import or export entrustment activities, the taxed price is VAT-
exclusive remunerations or commissions earned from these activities.

12. For goods and services with payment documents showing VAT- inclusive payment prices,
such as stamps, freight or fare tickets or lottery tickets, their VAT-exclusive prices shall be
determined as follows:

VAT-exclusive price =

13. For electricity supplied by a hydropower plant being a dependent cost-accounting unit of
Electricity of Vietnam, including electricity of dependent cost-accounting hydropower plants of
power generation corporations under Electricity of Vietnam, the taxed price for determining
the payable VAT amount in the locality where such plant is located equals 60% of the VAT-
exclusive average commodity electricity sale price in the previous year. In case the average
commodity electricity sale price in the previous year cannot be determined yet, a temporarily


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 18 ---
calculated price announced by the Group may apply but must not be lower than the price of
the previous year. When the average commodity electricity sale price in the previous year can
be determined, declaration for difference adjustment shall be made in the declaration period
of the month when the official price is available. The average commodity electricity sale price
in a year must be determined before March 31 of the following year.

14. For casino, prize-winning electronic game or betting game services, the taxed price is the
excise tax-inclusive sums of money earned from these services minus prizes paid to
customers.

The taxed price shall be calculated according to the following formula:
Taxed price =
Example 41: In a tax period, a casino records the following figures:

- Cash amount collected from customers for token exchange at counters before playing
games: VND 43 billion.

- Cash amount paid to customers for tokens returned after playing games: VND 10 billion.

Cash amount actually collected by the casino: VND 43 billion — VND 10 billion = VND 33
billion.

The VND 33 billion-amount is the casino’s turnover inclusive of VAT and excise tax.
The taxed price shall be calculated as follows:
Taxed price = = VND 30 billion

15. For transportation, loading and unloading services, the taxed price is VAT-exclusive
freight or loading and unloading charge rate, regardless of whether establishments directly
provide transportation, loading and unloading services or outsource such services.

16. For tourist services in the form of tours under contracts signed with tourists at a package
price (inclusive of meals, accommodation and transportation), this package price is regarded
as the VAT-inclusive price.

The taxed price shall be determined according to the following formula:
Taxed price =

In case the package price covers inbound and outbound air fares, expenses for meals,
accommodation and sight-seeing and some other expenses incurred abroad (provided they
are accompanied with lawful documents), the sum of money collected from tourists to cover
these expenses may be subtracted from the taxed price (turnover). The input VAT for
package tourist activities may be wholly declared and credited under regulations.

Example 42: Ho Chi Minh City Tourist Company performs a package tour contract with
Thailand for 50 tourists for 5 days in Vietnam with a total payment of USD 32,000. The
Vietnamese side has to pay for airfares, meals, accommodation, and sight-seeing tours under
the agreed program, of which the airfares from Thailand to Vietnam and vice versa cost USD
10,000. The applicable exchange rate is USD 1 = VND 20,000.

The taxed price under this contract shall be determined as follows:
+ The VAT-liable turnover is:
(USD 32,000 - USD 10,000) x VND 20,000 = VND 440,000,000
+ The taxed price is:
= VND 400,000,000
The Company may wholly declare and credit the input VAT for VAT- liable tourist activities.

Example 43: Hanoi Tourist Company performs a contract for taking tourists from Vietnam to
China on a five-day tour at the package price of USD 400/tourist. If it has to pay a Chinese
tourist company USD 300/tourist, its taxed price (turnover) is USD 100/tourist (USD 400 -
USD 300).

17. For pawning service, the amount receivable from this service, including the interest


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 19 ---
receivable from pawn loans and other proceeds from the sale of pawned articles (if any), shall
be determined as the VAT-inclusive price.

The taxed price shall be determined according to the following formula:
Taxed price =

Example 44: A pawning company generates in a tax period a pawning turnover of VND 110
million.

The taxed price shall be determined as follows:
= VND 100 million

18. For a VAT-liable book sold at the distribution price (cover price) under the Publication
Law, this sale price shall be determined as the VAT- inclusive price for calculating VAT and
turnover of the seller. For a book sold at a price other than the cover price, VAT shall be
calculated based on the actual sale price.

19. For printing activities, the taxed price is the printing cost. If a printing establishment
performs printing contracts with payment prices covering printing and paper costs, the taxed
price also includes the paper cost.

20. For the services of assessment agency, agency for indemnity consideration, agency for
claiming compensations from third parties and agency for handling of wholly compensated
goods for remuneration or commission, the taxed price is the earned VAT-exclusive
remuneration or commission amount (with expenses not yet subtracted) collected by
insurance enterprises.

21. For the cases of purchasing the services specified in Clause 5, Article 3 of this Circular,
the taxed price is the VAT-exclusive payment price indicated in the service purchase contract.

22. The taxed price of goods and services specified in Clauses 1 thru

21 of this Article covers revenues and surcharges earned by business establishments in
addition to goods and service prices.

In case a business establishment offers a commercial discount for customers (if any), the
taxed price is the discounted price. In case the commercial discount is based on the quantity
and sales of goods or services, the discounted amount of goods sold shall be adjusted on the
goods and service sale invoice upon the last purchase or in the subsequent period. In case
the discounted amount is recorded when the discount program (period) ends, the
establishment may issue an adjustment invoice, enclosed with a list of serial numbers of
invoices which need to be adjusted, the adjusted amounts and tax amounts. Based on the
adjustment invoice, the seller and buyer shall declare adjustments to sale and purchase
turnovers and input and output tax amounts.

Taxed prices must be calculated in Vietnam dong. In case a taxpayer has foreign-currency
turnover, such turnover must be converted into Vietnam dong at the average inter-bank
exchange rate announced by the State Bank of Vietnam at the time turnover is generated for
taxed price determination.

Article 9. Tax rate of 0%

1. The 0% tax rate applies to exported goods and services; construction and installation of
works overseas and in non-tariff zones; international transportation; and goods and services
not liable to VAT upon exportation, except cases ineligible for the 0% tax rate under Clause 3
of this Article.

Exported goods and services are goods and services sold and provided to overseas
organizations and individuals and consumed outside Vietnam; sold and provided to
organizations and individuals in non-tariff zones; or provided to foreign customers in
accordance with law.

a/ Exported goods include:
- Goods exported abroad, including those exported under entrustment contracts;

- Goods sold into non-tariff zones under the Prime Minister's regulations; goods sold to duty-
free shops;

- Sold goods which are delivered and received outside Vietnam;

- Spare parts used for repair and maintenance of vehicles, machinery and equipment for
foreign parties and consumed outside Vietnam;

- Cases regarded as exportation under law:

+ Intermediary processed goods under the commercial law regarding international goods
trading and goods trading and processing agency with foreign parties.

+ On-spot exports as prescribed by law.
+ Goods exported for sale at overseas fairs and exhibitions.

b/ Exported services include services provided directly to overseas organizations and
individuals and consumed outside Vietnam; or provided directly to organizations or
individuals in non-tariff Zones and consumed in non-tariff zones.

Overseas individuals are foreigners not residing in Vietnam and Vietnamese residing
overseas and not present in Vietnam during the provision of services. Organizations and
individuals in non-tariff zones are those with business registration and other cases specified
by the Prime Minister.

In case services are provided both inside and outside Vietnam while service contracts are
signed between two taxpayers present in Vietnam or having resident establishments in
Vietnam, the 0% tax rate applies only to the value of services provided outside Vietnam,
except the case of provision of insurance services for imported goods in which the 0% tax
rate applies to the whole contractual value. In case it is impossible to determine the value of
services provided in Vietnam under the contract, the taxed price shall be determined based
on the percentage (%) of expenses arising in Vietnam to total expenses.

Service providers being taxpayers in Vietnam must have documents proving that services
are provided outside Vietnam.

Example 45: Company B signs a contract with company C on the provision of consultancy,
survey and design services for company C’s investment project in Cambodia (both
companies are Vietnamese businesses). If the contract covers services provided in Vietnam
and services provided in Cambodia, then the value of services provided in Cambodia is
eligible for the 0% tax rate. Company B shall declare and calculate VAT under regulations
for turnover from services provided in Vietnam.


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 21 ---
Example 46: Company D provides company X with consultancy, survey and feasibility
report making services for an investment project in Laos. The contractual value received
by company D is VND 5 billion inclusive of VAT for the services provided in Vietnam. Under
this contract, it is impossible to determine turnover generated in Vietnam and turnover
generated in Laos. Company D has calculated expenses arising in Laos (survey and
exploration expenses) of VND 1.5 billion and expenses arising in Vietnam (summarization
and reporting expenses) of VND 2.5 billion.

VAT-inclusive turnover from the services provided in Vietnam shall be determined as follows:
VND 2.5 billion

VND 5 billion x = VND 3.125 billion
VND 2.5 billion + VND 1.5 billion

In case company D has documents proving that it has sent its officers to conduct survey and
exploration and that it has purchased some types of goods for survey and exploration in Laos,
turnover from the services provided in Laos is eligible for the 0% tax rate and equals VND
1.875 billion (VND 5 billion - VND 3.125 billion = VND 1.875 billion).

c/ International transportation referred to in this Clause covers transportation of passengers,
luggage and cargo on international routes from Vietnam to overseas or vice versa or from an
overseas place to another, regardless of whether means of transport are available. In case an
international transportation contract covers domestic routes, international transportation also
covers such domestic routes.

Example 47: Transportation company X in Vietnam, which has ships for international
transportation, transports cargo from Singapore to the Republic of Korea. Turnover from such
transportation is turnover from international transportation.

Section 2. TAX CALCULATION METHODS
Article 12. Tax credit method

1. The tax credit method applies to businesses that fully observe accounting, invoice and
document regimes in accordance with the law on accounting, invoices and documents,
including:

a/ Currently operating businesses that have an annual turnover of at least VND 1 billion
from goods sale or service provision and fully observe the accounting, invoice and
document regimes in accordance with the law on accounting, invoices and documents,
except business households and individuals paying tax by the direct calculation method
guided in Article 13 of this Circular;

b/ Businesses that register for voluntary application of the tax credit method, except business
households and individuals paying tax by the direct calculation method guided in Article 13 of
this Circular;

c/ Foreign organizations and individuals supplying goods or providing services serving oil
and gas exploration, prospection, development and exploitation for whom tax is declared,
credited and paid by their Vietnamese partners by the credit method.

2. The annual turnover of at least VND 1 billion used as a basis for determining a business's
eligibility for paying VAT by the credit method specified at Point a, Clause 1 of this Article
is the turnover from sale of VAT- liable goods or provision of VAT-liable services, and is
determined as follows:


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 26 ---
a/ The business shall itself determine its annual turnover by adding up the item “Total sales
of VAT-liable goods and services” in the monthly VAT declarations of the tax periods from
November of the preceding year to the end of October of the present year preceding the
year for which the VAT calculation method is determined or in the quarterly VAT declarations
of the tax periods from the fourth quarter of the preceding year to the end of the third
quarter of the present year preceding the year for which the VAT calculation method is
determined. The duration of stable application of the tax calculation method is 2
consecutive years.

Example 51: Enterprise A was established in 2011 and is now operating. In 2013, in order to
determine the VAT calculation method to be applied in 2014 and 2015, enterprise A shall
determine its turnover as follows:

To add up the item “Total sales of VAT-liable goods and services” in the monthly VAT
declarations of 12 months (from November 2012 to the end of October 2013).

If the turnover determined as guided above is VND 1 billion or more, enterprise A shall apply
the tax credit method in 2 years (2014 and 2015).

If the turnover determined as guided above is less than VND 1 billion, enterprise A shall
apply the direct calculation method prescribed in Article 13 of this Circular in 2 years (2014
and 2015), unless it registers for voluntary application of the tax credit method according to
Clause 3 of this Article.

b/ In case the business was just established in 2013 and has been operating for less than 12
months, it shall estimate its annual turnover as follows: To add up the item “Total sales of
VAT-liable goods and services” in the VAT declarations of months of conducting production
or business activities, divide (:) that figure by the number of months of conducting production
or business activities, then multiply (x) the result by 12 months. In case the turnover
estimated as guided above is VND 1 billion or more, the business shall apply the tax credit
method. In case the turnover estimated as guided above is less than VND 1 billion, the
business shall apply the direct calculation method in 2 years, unless it registers for voluntary
application of the tax credit method.

Example 52: Enterprise B was established and started operating in March 2013. In order to
determine the tax calculation method for 2014 and 2015, enterprise B shall estimate its
turnover as follows: To add up the item “Total sales of VAT-liable goods and services” in the
VAT declarations of March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October and
November, divide (:) that figure by 9 months and then multiply (x) the result by 12 months.

If the turnover estimated as guided above is VND 1 billion or more, enterprise B shall apply
the tax credit method. If the turnover estimated as guided above is less than VND 1 billion,
enterprise B shall apply the direct calculation method in 2014 and 2015, unless it registers for
voluntary application of the tax credit method.

c/ In case the business declares tax on a quarterly basis from July 2013, it shall determine its
annual turnover as follows: To add up the item “Total sales of VAT-liable goods and
services” in the VAT declarations of the tax periods of October, November and December of
2012 and the first 6 months of 2013 andin the VAT declaration of the third quarter of
2013. If its turnover determined as guided above is VND 1 billion or more, the business
shall apply the tax credit method. If its turnover determined as guided above is less than
VND 1 billion, the business shall apply the direct calculation method in 2 years, unless it
registers for voluntary application of the tax credit method.

d/ In case the business suspends its business activities for a whole year, the tax calculation
method shall be determined based on the turnover of the year preceding the year of
suspension of business activities.

In case the business suspends its business activities for a certain period of time in a year, its
turnover shall be determined based on the number of months or quarters of actually doing
business as guided at Point b of this Clause.

If the business operated for less than 12 months in the year preceding the year of
suspension of business activities, its turnover shall be determined based on the number of
months or quarters of actually doing business as guided at Point b of this Clause.

--- PAGE 27 ---
3. Businesses registering for voluntary application of the tax credit method include:

a/ Currently operating enterprises and cooperatives that have an annual turnover of less than
VND 1 billion from sale of VAT-liable goods and provision of VAT-liable services and fully
observe the accounting, invoice and document regimes in accordance with the law on
accounting, invoices and documents;

b/ Enterprises newly established under investment projects of currently operating businesses
that pay VAT by the credit method;

c/ Newly established enterprises and cooperatives that invest in or purchase fixed assets,
machinery or equipment (excluding passenger cars of 9 seats or less of businesses not
dealing in transport, tourism or hotel business) valued at VND 1 billion or more as indicated
on the invoices on purchase of fixed assets, machinery or equipment, including invoices on
purchase of fixed assets, machinery and equipment before such enterprises or cooperatives
are established; foreign organizations and individuals doing business in Vietnam under
contractor or subcontractor contracts;

d/ Economic organizations other than enterprises or cooperatives that can account input VAT
and output VAT.

Enterprises and cooperatives guided at Point a of this Clause shall send a notice on the
application of the tax credit method to their managing tax offices by December 20 every year.

Businesses guided at Points b and c of this Clause shall send a notice of the applicable tax
calculation method to their managing tax offices together with tax registration dossiers.

Businesses guided at Point d of this Clause shall send a notice of the applicable tax
calculation method to their managing tax office by December 20 of the year preceding the
year of applying the new tax calculation method.

Within 5 working days after receiving a notice on the application of the tax credit method, the
tax office shall issue a written reply to the concerned enterprise, cooperative or business
stating its approval or disapproval of the application of the tax credit method.

4. Other cases:

a/ Businesses engaged in gold, silver or gem sale, purchase and fashioning activities shall
separately account these activities so as to pay tax by the method of direct calculation on
added value guided in Article 13 of this Circular;

b/ Newly established enterprises and cooperatives other than those specified in Clause 3 of
this Article shall apply the direct calculation method guided in Article 13 of this Circular;

By the end of the first calendar year after its establishment, if an enterprise or a
cooperative has a turnover of VND 1 billion or more determined by the method specified in
Clause 2 of this Article and fully observes the accounting, invoice and document regimes
in accordance with the law on accounting, invoices and documents, it shall apply the tax
credit method. The procedures for changing the tax calculation method comply with the law
on tax administration.

By the end of the first calendar year after its establishment, if the enterprise or cooperative
fails to reach a turnover of at least VND 1 billion, it shall continue applying the direct
calculation method.

Example 53: Trading and service limited liability company X was established and started
operating in April 2014. The company applies the direct calculation method for VAT periods of
2014. By the end of the tax period of November 2014, the company determines its turnover
as follows:

To add up the total sales item in the VAT declarations of tax periods from April through
November 2014, divide that figure by 8 months, then multiply the result by 12 months.

If the estimated turnover is VND 1 billion or more, company X shall apply the tax credit
method from January 1, 2015, for 2015 and 2016. In case the turnover estimated by the
above method is less than VND 1 billion, company X shall further apply the direct calculation
method in 2015 and 2016. The VAT calculation method to be applied by company X in 2017
and 2018 shall be determined based on its turnover in 2016.


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 28 ---
5. Determination of the payable VAT amount:
Payable VAT amount = Output VAT amount - Creditable input VAT amount
In which:

a/ The output VAT amount equals the total VAT amount of goods sold or services provided
as indicated on an added-value invoice.

The VAT amount indicated on an added-value invoice equals the taxed price of the taxable
goods or service sold multiplied by (x) the VAT rate applicable to such goods or service.

In case of using documents indicating a VAT-inclusive price, the output VAT amount shall be
determined to be equal to this price minus (-) the taxed price specified in Clause 12, Article 7
of this Circular.

Businesses paying VAT calculated by the tax credit method shall, when selling goods or
providing services, calculate and pay VAT on the goods sold or services provided. On
invoices issued for the sale of goods or provision of services, businesses shall write VAT-
exclusive sale prices, VAT amounts and total amounts payable by purchasers. If an
invoice indicates only the payment price (except cases in which special-type documents
may be used) but not the VAT-exclusive price and VAT amount, the VAT amount on the
goods or services shall be calculated based on the price indicated on the invoice or
document.

Example 54: An enterprise sells F6 iron rods at a VAT-exclusive price of VND
11,000,000/ton, the 10% VAT amount is VND 1,100,000/ton, but on some of its sale
invoices, only the sale price of VND 12,100,000/ton is indicated, then the VAT amount
calculated on the basis of sales shall be determined as follows: VND 12,100,000/ton x 10% =
VND 1,210,000/ton, instead of being calculated based on the VAT-exclusive price of VND
11,000,000/ton.

Businesses shall observe the accounting, invoice and document regimes in accordance with
the law on accounting, invoices and documents. Cases in which VAT rates are wrongly
indicated on invoices and not yet adjusted by businesses themselves but detected through
inspection by tax offices shall be handled as follows:

For businesses selling goods or providing services: If the VAT rate indicated on an invoice is
higher than that prescribed in legal documents on VAT, VAT shall be declared and paid at
the rate indicated on the invoice. If the VAT rate indicated on the invoice is lower than that
prescribed in legal documents on VAT, VAT shall be declared and paid at the rate prescribed
in legal documents on VAT.

b/ The input VAT amount equals (=) the total VAT amount indicated on the added-value
invoice for purchased goods or services (including also fixed assets) used for the production
of and trading in VAT-liable goods or services or the VAT amount indicated on the duty
payment documents for imported goods or the documents of VAT payment for foreign parties
under the Ministry of Finance’s guidance applicable to foreign organizations without the
Vietnamese legal entity status and foreigners doing business or earning incomes in Vietnam.

If purchased goods or services are those for which special-type documents indicating VAT-
inclusive prices are used, businesses may base themselves on these VAT-inclusive prices
and the tax calculation method specified in Clause 12, Article 7 of this Circular to determine
the VAT- exclusive price and input VAT amount.

The creditable input VAT amount shall be determined based on the VAT credit principles and
conditions prescribed in Articles 14, 15, 16 and 17 of this Circular.

Example 55: In a tax period, company A made payment for input services of a special type
eligible for tax credit:

The total price is VND 110 million (inclusive of VAT). This service is subject to the tax rate of
10%. The creditable input VAT amount shall be calculated as follows:

x 10% = VND 10 million
The VAT-exclusive price is VND 100 million and the VAT amount is VND 10 million.

--- PAGE 29 ---
Cases in which VAT rates are wrongly indicated on invoices and not yet adjusted by
businesses themselves but detected through inspection by tax offices shall be handled as
follows:

For businesses purchasing goods or services: If the VAT rate indicated on an invoice is
higher than that prescribed in legal documents on VAT, the input VAT shall be credited at the
rate prescribed in these legal documents. If it is possible to conclude that the seller has
declared and paid tax at the rate indicated on the invoice, the input VAT may be credited at
this rate but the written certification of the seller's managing tax office is required. If the
VAT rate indicated on an invoice is lower than that prescribed in legal documents on VAT,
the input VAT shall be credited at the rate indicated on the invoice.

For businesses selling goods or services: In case a business has declared and paid VAT at
the stage of importation, when selling such goods to a consumer, it issues an added-value
invoice indicating the VAT rate equaling the rate at which it has declared and paid tax at the
stage of importation and which, however, is lower than that prescribed in legal documents on
VAT and the business cannot collect extra money from the customer, the amount already
collected from the customer according to the added-value invoice shall be determined as the
VAT-inclusive price with the tax rate prescribed in legal documents on VAT to serve as a
basis for determining the payable VAT amount and turnover for calculation of enterprise
income tax.

Example 56: In March 2014, business A (that pays VAT by the credit method) imported
products named “CHAIR MM” and declared and paid VAT at the tax rate of 5% at the stage of
importation. In May 2015, business A sold a “CHAIR MM” product to customer B at a VAT-
exclusive price of VND 100 million. Due to the fact that the tax rate of 5% was applied upon
importation, business A issued and handed over to customer B an added- value invoice
indicating the taxed price of VND 100 million, the VAT rate of 5% and the VAT amount of
VND 5 million, and the total VAT-inclusive price of VND 105 million. Customer B has fully paid
VND 105 million.

In 2015, the tax office detects through inspection that the VAT rate applied by business A to
the “CHAIR MM” product sold to customer B was wrong (the correct rate should be 10%).
As the transaction between business

A and customer B has completed, business A has no ground to collect extra money from
customer B (customer B refuses to pay the increased tax amount). The tax office shall re-
determine the VAT amount payable by business A and turnover for calculation of enterprise
income tax as follows:

The total price of VND 105 million, which has been paid by customer B, shall be determined
as the VAT-inclusive price with the tax rate of 10%. The payable VAT amount shall be
determined as follows:

x 10% = VND 9.545 million

The VAT amount to be additionally paid by business A is: VND 9.545 million - VND 5 million =
VND 4.545 million.

The turnover from the “CHAIR MM” product sold to customer B, which is used for calculation
of enterprise income tax, is:

VND 105 million - VND 9.545 million = VND 95.455 million.
Article 13. Method of VAT calculation directly based on added value

1. For gold, silver or gem sale, purchase and fashioning, the payable VAT amount calculated
by the method of direct calculation on added value equals the added value multiplied by the
VAT rate of 10%.

The added value of gold, silver or gems equals the payment price of the sold gold, silver or
gems minus (-) the payment price of the corresponding purchased gold, silver or gems.

The payment price of the sold gold, silver and gems is the actual sale price indicated on the
sale invoice, which is inclusive of fashioning remuneration (if any), VAT, extra charges and
surcharges enjoyed by the seller.


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 30 ---
The payment price of purchased gold, silver and gems equals the VAT- inclusive value of the
purchased or imported gold, silver or gems used for the purchase, sale or fashioning of the
corresponding sold gold, silver or gems.

In case there arises in a tax period a negative (-) added value of gold, silver or gems, it may

be cleared against the positive (+) added value of gold, silver or gems. When there arises no
positive (+) added value or such value is not enough to offset the negative (-) added value,
it may be carried forward for deduction from the added value of the next period in the year.

By the end of the calendar year, the negative (-) added value may not be carried forward to
the following year.

2. The method of calculating the payable VAT amount directly on the added value by
multiplying turnover by a certain rate (%) is applied as follows:

a/ Subjects of application:

- Currently operating enterprises and cooperatives that have an annual turnover of less than
VND 1 billion, except those registering for voluntary application of the tax credit method
prescribed in Clause 3, Article 12 of this Circular;

- Newly established enterprises and cooperatives, except those registering for voluntary
application of the tax credit method prescribed in Clause 3, Article 12 of this Circular;

- Business households and individuals;

- Foreign organizations and individuals that conduct business in Vietnam not under the
Investment Law and other organizations that fail to observe or improperly observe the
accounting, invoice and document regimes prescribed by law, except foreign organizations
and individuals providing goods and services for oil and gas exploration, prospection,
development and exploitation.

- Economic organizations other than enterprises and cooperatives, except those registering
to pay tax by the credit method.

b/ The rate (%) used for calculating VAT on turnover is specified for each activity as follows:
- 1%, for goods distribution and supply;
- 5%, for services and construction without contracted supply of materials;

- 3%, for production, transportation and services associated with supply of goods,
construction with contracted supply of materials;

- 2%, for other business activities.

c/ Turnover used for VAT calculation is the total sales of goods and services indicated on
VAT-liable goods and service sale invoices, inclusive of extra charges and surcharges
enjoyed by businesses.

These above rates do not apply to turnovers from sale of goods or provision of services not
liable to VAT and turnovers from exported goods and services.

Example 57: Limited liability company A declares and pays VAT by the direct calculation
method. It has turnover from sale of computer software and provision of business start-up
consultancy services. Company A is not required to pay VAT at a rate (%) of turnover from
sale of computer software (as computer software is not liable to VAT) and shall declare and
pay VAT at the rate of 5% of turnover from provision of business start-up consultancy
services.

A business engaged in different business lines which are subject to different rates shall
declare VAT according to each group of business lines corresponding to each prescribed
rate. In case the taxpayer cannot determine turnover from each group of business lines or a
business contract covers activities subject to different rates which cannot be separated, the
highest rate among those applied to the taxpayer's business lines shall apply.

3. For business households and individuals paying presumptive tax, tax offices shall
determine turnover and payable VAT amounts based on the rate (%) of their turnover as
guided in Clause 2 of this Article on the basis of tax data declared by these households or


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 31 ---
individuals, tax offices’ database, actual turnover inspection results and opinions of
commune-level tax consultancy councils.

For a household or an individual that is engaged in different business lines, tax offices shall
determine the payable tax amount based on the rate applicable to its/his/her main business
activity.

4. The list of business lines subject to calculation of VAT at a rate (%) of turnover under
Clause 2, Article 3 of this Article is promulgated together with this Circular.

Chapter Ill

TAX CREDIT AND REFUND
Section 1. TAX CREDIT
Article 14. Principles of input value-added tax credit

1. Input VAT on goods or services used for the production of and trading in VAT-liable goods
and services may be wholly credited, including also the uncompensated input value-added
tax on lost VAT-liable goods.

Input VAT on uncompensated losses, including those caused by natural disasters and fires,
and uninsured losses, and poor-quality and expired goods that must be destroyed, may be
credited. Business establishments must have adequate dossiers and documents proving
uncompensated losses for tax credit.

For goods exposed to natural loss in transportation and filling due to their physic and
chemical properties such as petrol, oil, etc., the input VAT amount on the actual volume of
goods lost naturally, which must not exceed the prescribed loss limit, may be declared and
credited. The input VAT amount on the volume of naturally lost goods exceeding the
prescribed limit may not be credited and refunded.

Input VAT on goods and services which form fixed assets like canteens providing shift meals,
mid-shift rest rooms, locker rooms, parking lots, restrooms and water tanks for laborers within
production or business premises, and houses and healthcare stations for workers in industrial
parks, may be wholly credited.

For housing rented by business establishments for workers in industrial parks in accordance
with regulations on design standards and rental for industrial park workers, VAT on such
rental may be credited under regulations. For business establishments that build or purchase
houses outside industrial parks for their workers working in industrial parks in compliance with
regulations on housing design standards for industrial park workers, the VAT on these houses
may be wholly credited.

Vietnam-based business establishments that employ foreign specialists to work as managers
in Vietnam and pay them salaries in Vietnam under signed labor contracts may not credit the
VAT amount on house rentals paid for these foreign specialists.

In case foreign specialists remain employees and under the management of overseas
enterprises, and receive salaries and other benefits from overseas enterprises during their
work in Vietnam under contracts between these overseas enterprises and Vietnam-based
business establishments which state that Vietnam-based businesses shall pay housing
expenses for foreign specialists during their work in Vietnam, the VAT amount on house
rentals for foreign specialists paid by Vietnam-based business establishments may be
credited.

2. For goods or services (including also fixed assets) used for the production of and trading in
both goods or services liable and not liable to VAT, only the input VAT amount on goods or
services used for the production of and trading in VAT-liable goods or services is creditable.
Businesses shall separately account creditable and non-creditable VAT amounts. If it is
impossible to do so, input VAT shall be credited based on the percentage (%) of VAT-liable
turnover to total turnover of sold goods or services that cannot be separately accounted.

Traders of goods or services liable and not liable to VAT shall every month temporarily
allocate VAT amounts on purchased VAT-creditable goods, services or fixed assets. At the
year end, they shall calculate the creditable VAT amount for the whole year for declaration to


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 32 ---
adjust input VAT amounts which have been temporarily credited every month.

3. Input VAT on fixed assets, machinery and equipment, including input VAT on lease,
warranty and repair of these assets, machinery and equipment, in the following cases may
not be credited but shall be included in the historical costs of these fixed assets or in
deductible expenses under the Law on Enterprise Income Tax and guiding documents: fixed
assets exclusively used for the manufacture of weapons and military equipment for national
defense and security purposes; fixed assets, machinery and equipment of credit institutions
and reinsurance, life insurance and securities businesses, health establishments and training
institutions; civil aircraft and yachts not used for commercial transportation of cargo and
passengers, tourist or hotel business.

For fixed assets being passenger automobiles of 9 seats or less (excluding automobiles used
for cargo or passenger transportation or for tourist or hotel business) which are valued at
more than VND 1.6 billion (exclusive of VAT), the input VAT amount for the value exceeding
VND 1.6 billion may not be credited.

4. VAT credit in some specific cases:

a/ For business establishments which organize closed production and centralized cost-
accounting and use products not subject to VAT in different stages for the production of
goods subject to VAT, the input VAT amount in all stages may be wholly credited.

Example 58: Enterprise X invests in building material zones and plants to produce and
process frozen tra and basa fish fillets and shrimps for export. It organizes closed production
from rearing, including also hiring breeders while investing in fry, ponds, lakes, fences,
irrigation systems, boats and ships, and other input materials such as feeds, veterinary
medicine and veterinary services, to shrimp and fish processing for export. The enterprise
may credit all input VAT amounts on fixed assets and purchased goods and services not
forming fixed assets in all stages of production and processing.

Example 59: Enterprise Y invests in building material zones and plants to produce and
process products made from raw milk (pasteurized milk, yogurt, cheese, and etc). It organizes
closed production from rearing, including also hiring breeders while investing in animal breeds
(cows, goats), stables, farms, fences, milking equipment, sanitation systems for breeding
facilities and other input materials such as feeds, veterinary medicine and veterinary services,
to processing dairy products. The enterprise may credit all input VAT amounts on fixed assets
and purchased goods and services not forming fixed assets in all stages of production and
processing.

b/ For business establishments, including newly established ones, which have investment
projects implemented in different phases, have

production and business plans, organize closed production and centralized cost-accounting,
and use products not subject to VAT for the production of goods subject to VAT but provide
goods and services not subject to VAT in the phase of capital construction investment, the
input VAT amount in the investment phase to form fixed assets may be wholly credited.
Business establishments shall separately account the declared and creditable input VAT
amounts not for fixed assets used for the production of goods and provision of services not
liable to VAT based on the percentage (%) of turnover subject to VAT to the total turnover of
goods and services sold.

Business establishments that have investment projects for further production and processing
or make a written commitment to further produce VAT-liable products may declare and credit
VAT right from the stage of capital construction. For input VAT arising in the capital
construction stage, enterprises which have declared and credited tax or had tax refunded, but
are later determined as ineligible for tax credit or refund, shall declare, adjust and return the
credited and refunded VAT amounts. For businesses that fail to make adjustments and are
detected through tax inspection and examination, tax offices shall collect tax arrears and
refunded tax amounts and impose fines under regulations. Businesses shall take full
responsibility before law for tax credit and refund-related contents they have reported,
committed and explained to tax offices.

For establishments selling unprocessed or preliminarily processed agricultural, forest, aquatic
or marine products not liable to VAT, the VAT amount on purchased goods and services may


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 33 ---
be credited based on the percentage (%) of sales of VAT-liable goods or services to total
sales of goods or services.

Example 60: Enterprise A investing in rubber farms has an input VAT amount on goods and
services at the stage of capital construction. It has not yet had any products as materials for
further production and processing of VAT-liable products (including also unprocessed exports
or processed products liable to VAT), but has a project to build a rubber latex mill (liable to
VAT) and commits that cultivated products will be further processed into VAT-liable products.
In this case, the enterprise may credit all input VAT amounts.

If the enterprise sells all the project’s rubber latex, which is not liable to VAT, it may not credit
tax.

If the enterprise uses part of the project’s exploited rubber latex for the production VAT-liable
products while selling the rest, input VAT shall be credited as follows:

- Input VAT amount on fixed assets (rubber farm, processing mill, etc.): To be wholly credited
(including also VAT amounts arising at the stage of capital construction).

- Input VAT amount on goods and services: To be credited based on the percentage (%) of
sales of VAT-liable goods and services to total sales of goods and services.

c/ For business establishments, including newly-established ones, which have investment
projects and invest in the production and trading of goods and services both liable and not
liable to VAT, the input VAT amount for fixed assets in the capital construction investment
phase may be temporarily credited at the percentage (%) of turnover of goods and services to
the total turnover of goods and services sold under production and business plans of these
business establishments. The temporarily credited tax amount shall be adjusted based on the
percentage (%) of turnover of VAT- liable goods and services to the total turnover of goods
and services sold within three years counting from the first year in which turnover is
generated.

Example 61: Enterprise Z is newly established under a transport investment project. A
business scheme under its investment project has turnover from public passenger transport
by bus and not by bus, advertisements and vehicle repair and maintenance service, in which
bus transport makes up 30% of total sales of goods and services. The capital construction
investment phase including purchasing vehicles and building stations and workshops lasts
two years from June 2014, to May 2016. During these two years, the input VAT amount for
fixed assets in the capital construction investment phase and for goods and services
purchased for the enterprise’s establishment (business establishment expenses) may be
temporarily credited at the rate of 70% and refunded under regulations (but the VAT amount
on fixed assets that are automobiles registered to be used as buses may not be credited). It
starts generating turnover in June 2016. The turnover from bus transport during the three
years from June 2016 to the end of May 2019, makes up 35% of the total turnover of goods
and services sold. In this case, the enterprise shall make declaration for reduction of the
credited and refunded VAT amount on fixed assets at the rate of 5% (= 70% - 65%) and
include such amount to the VAT amount of the declaration period of May 2019. It will not have
to pay any fines or interests for late payment of the credited VAT amount on fixed assets to
be reduced.

5. Input VAT on goods (including also goods purchased from outside or goods manufactured
by enterprises themselves) used by enterprises as donations or gifts or for sale promotion or
advertising in various forms to serve the production of and trading in VAT-liable goods and
services is creditable.

6. The VAT amounts already paid under customs offices’ tax assessment decisions may be
wholly credited, except cases of fraud and tax evasion sanctioned by customs offices.

7. Input VAT on goods and services used for the production of or trading in goods and
services not liable to VAT under Article 4 of this Circular may not be credited, except the
following cases:

al VAT on goods and services purchased by business establishments for the production of or
trading in goods and provision of services to foreign organizations and individuals or
international organizations for provision of humanitarian aid or non-refundable aid specified in


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 34 ---
Clause 19, Article 4 of this Circular, may be wholly credited;

b/ Input VAT on goods and services used in prospecting, exploring and developing oil and
gas fields to the first day of exploitation or production may be wholly credited.

8. Input VAT arising in a period may be declared for credit immediately when the tax amount
payable in that period is determined, regardless of whether relevant goods or services have
been delivered for use or remain in stock.

Business establishments detecting errors in the declaration and credit of input VAT may make
additional declaration and credit before tax offices or competent agencies announce decisions
on tax examination and inspection at their offices.

9. Business establishments may either account non-creditable input VAT amounts as
expenses for enterprise income tax calculation or include them in the historical costs of fixed
assets, except VAT amounts on goods and services valued at VND 20 million or higher for
each purchase without non-cash payment documents.

10. Corporations’ or business groups’ offices that are not directly engaged in business
operations and subsidiary administrative and non-business units such as hospitals, clinics,
sanatoriums, institutes, training establishments, etc., which are not VAT payers, are not
entitled to input VAT credit or refund for goods and services purchased for their operations.

When these units also deal in VAT-liable goods and services, they shall separately register,
declare and pay VAT for these operations.

Example 62: The office of Corporation A is not directly engaged in production and business
activities and operates with funds contributed by subsidiary units. If it leases the unused
space of its house (office building), it shall separately account, declare and pay VAT for the
office lease. The input VAT on goods and services used for the operation of the Corporation’s
office is neither credited nor refunded.

11. Input VAT on goods and services used for the provision of goods and services not
subject to VAT declaration and payment under Article 5 of this Circular (except Clauses 2 and
3, Article 5) may be wholly credited.

12. Business establishments may declare and credit VAT on goods and services purchased
through authorization to other organizations or individuals and authorized organizations or
individuals are named in the purchase invoices, including the following cases:

a/ Insurance businesses that authorize insured parties to repair assets and pay insured
parties corresponding indemnities under insurance policies for the expenses for asset
repair and supplies and spare parts with value- added invoices indicating the insured
parties’ names, may declare and credit VAT amounts corresponding to the indemnities paid
according to the value- added invoices indicating the insured parties’ names. For
indemnities valued at VND 20 million or higher, insurance businesses shall pay them via
bank to insured parties.

b/ Before establishing a business, its founders make a written authorization for an
organization or a person to pay some expenses related to such establishment and for the
purchase of goods and supplies. The business may declare and credit input VAT according
to invoices indicating the name of the authorized organization or person and shall pay that
organization or person via bank for invoices valued at VND 20 million or higher.

13. For non-business individuals and organizations contributing assets as capital to limited
liability or joint-stock companies, documents for these contributed assets are written records
of capital contribution and written records of asset delivery and receipt. If the contributed
assets are brand-new, have not been used, and have lawful invoices accepted by the capital
deli very and receipt council, the value of contributed capital is that indicated in the invoices
inclusive of VAT. The capital recipient may declare and credit VAT amounts indicated in the
invoices on purchase of the contributed assets.

14. Business establishments that pay VAT by tax calculation directly based on added value
and then change to pay tax by the tax credit method may credit VAT on purchased goods
and services arising from the first declaration period of paying tax by the tax credit method.


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 35 ---
Business establishments which pay VAT by the tax credit method and change to pay tax by
the method of calculation of tax based directly on added value may include the VAT amount
not fully credited for goods and services purchased in the period of tax payment by the tax
credit method in deductible expenses when determining incomes subject to enterprise
income tax, except the refundable VAT amount for goods and services purchased in the
period of tax payment by the tax credit method under Article 18 of this Circular and legal
documents effective before this Circular takes effect.

Example 63: Limited Liability Company A applies the tax credit method in 2014 and 2015
and is ineligible to apply the tax credit method from January 1, 2016. The company
already made and sent its dossier of request for tax refund to the tax office from the tax
period of November 2014 to the end of the tax period of October 2015 (the end of the time of
determining turnover for determining the method of tax calculation for 2016 and 2017),
indicating a refundable tax amount of VND 350 million and anon-credited input VAT
amount of VND 50 million in the VAT declaration of the tax period of November 2015.
Company A may be considered for tax refund under regulations for the dossier of request for
tax refund already sent to the tax office (the refundable tax amount of VND 350 million). The
non- credited input VAT amount of VND 50 million in the VAT declaration form of the tax
period of November 2015 may be transferred to the tax period of December 2015. Company
A may include the non-credited input VAT amount of the tax period of December 2015 in
deductible expenses when determining enterprise income tax-liable income.

15. Business establishments are not entitled to input VAT credit when:

- Value-added invoices are used in contravention of law such as value- added invoices not
indicating VAT amounts (except particular cases permitted for use of value-added invoices
indicating VAT-inclusive payment prices);

- Invoices do not indicate or incorrectly indicate such information as name, address and tax
identification number of the seller, making the seller unidentifiable;

- Invoices do not indicate or incorrectly indicate such information as name, address and tax
identification number of the buyer, making the buyer unidentifiable (except the cases
provided in Clause 12 of this Article);

- Invoices or VAT payment documents are false, invoices are erased or issued without actual
provision of goods or services;

- Invoices indicate unreal values of the goods or services traded or exchanged.
16. Other specific cases must comply with separate guidance of the Ministry of Finance.
Article 15. Conditions for input VAT credit

1. Having lawful value-added invoices of purchased goods or services or documents on
VAT payment at the importation stage or documents on VAT payment for foreign parties
under the Finance Ministry's guidance applicable to foreign organizations without Vietnamese
legal entity status and foreigners conducting business or earning incomes in Vietnam.

2. Having non-cash payment documents for purchased goods and services (including also
imported goods) valued at VND 20 million or higher, except cases in which the total invoiced
value of purchased goods or services at a time is less than VND 20 million calculated at VAT-
inclusive prices.

Non-cash payment documents comprise via-bank payment documents and other non-cash
payment documents guided in Clauses 3 and 4 of this Article.

3. Via-bank payment document means a document proving the money transfer from the
buyer’s account to the seller's account (the buyer’s and the sellers accounts must be
accounts that have been registered or notified to tax offices) opened at payment service
institutions by lawful methods of payment such as check, payment order, payment collection,
bank card, phone card (e- wallet) and other methods of payment under regulations (including
also the case in which the buyer makes payment from its account to the seller's account
bearing the name of a private enterprise owner or from its account bearing the name of a
private enterprise owner to the seller's account, provided such account has been registered
with a tax office for transaction).


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 36 ---
a/ Documents on the buyer’s deposit of cash into the seller's account or documents on
improper methods of payment under current law are ineligible for credit and refund of VAT on
goods and services purchased at VND 20 million or higher.

b/ Without via-bank payment documents, input VAT on purchased goods or services with
an invoiced value of VND 20 million or higher calculated at a VAT-inclusive price at a time is
not creditable. Business establishments shall declare these invoices in the section of goods
and services ineligible for tax credit in the list of invoices and documents of purchased goods
and services.

c/ For goods or services valued at VND 20 million or higher purchased on deferred or
installment payment, business establishments shall declare and credit input VAT based on
goods or service purchase contracts, value-added invoices and via-bank payment documents
of these goods or services, and, at the same time, write the payment time limit in the note
section of the list of invoices and documents of purchased goods and services. If via-bank
payment documents are not available yet as the payment under contracts is not due or before
December 31 every year in case the contractual payment time is earlier than December 31,
business establishments may still declare and credit input VAT.

If via-bank payment documents are unavailable by the contractual payment time or by
December 31 every year in case the contractual payment time is earlier than December
31, business establishments may not credit input VAT and shall declare and reduce input
VAT amounts already credited for the value of goods without via-bank payment documents. If
business establishments have documents proving via-bank payment after having reduced
the input VAT amount credited for the value of goods or services purchased without via-bank
payment documents, they may make additional declaration.

In case the deferred payment under contracts is overdue or by December 31 every year
and business establishments fail to make reductions under regulations but then have
adequate via-bank payment documents before tax offices or competent agencies
announce decisions on inspection at their offices, business establishments shall be
sanctioned for violation of tax procedures if their failure to make reductions does not
result in a deficit in payable tax amounts or an increase in refundable tax amounts. If their
failure to make reductions results in a deficit in payable tax amounts or an increase in
refundable tax amounts, business establishments are subject to collection of tax arrears
or refunded tax amounts and shall be sanctioned under the Tax Administration Law .

In case tax offices announce decisions on examination and inspection at the business
establishments’ offices and have decisions on disapproval of tax credit on value-added
invoices without via-bank payment documents, and the business establishments have
documents proving via-bank payment only after receiving the tax offices’ decisions:

- They may make additional VAT declaration for value-added invoices for which they have
made reductions before the tax inspection and examination is conducted.

- They may make additional declaration for value-added invoices that they fail to make
reductions before the tax inspection and examination if they have via-bank payment
documents within six months from the month they receive the tax office’s handling decision.

Example 64:

In 2014, Limited Liability Company ANB has the following value- added invoices for goods
purchase on deferred payment contracts:

- A value-added invoice for goods purchased in March 2014 and payment is due on
September 20, 2014.

- A value-added invoice for goods purchased in April 2014 and payment is due on October
20, 2014.

- A value-added invoice for goods purchased in May 2014 and payment is due on November
20, 2014.

- A value-added invoice for goods purchased in June 2014 and payment is due on December
20, 2014.


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 37 ---
Company ANB already declared VAT credit upon receiving value- added invoices for goods
purchase. If Company ANB has no via-bank payment documents when payment under
contracts is due, it shall select to declare reductions for each invoice, or if it has no via-bank
payment documents on December 31, 2014, it shall declare reductions for the four above
value-added invoices in the tax declaration period of December 2014 in accordance with
the tax administration law.

Example 65:
Limited Liability Company Super has the following situation:

Company Super has value-added invoices for goods purchase in February and March 2014
under contracts on deferred payment that is due October 31, 2014. Based on the value-
added invoices provided by the seller, company Super already declared VAT credit in the
VAT declarations of February and March 2014. Due to financial difficulties, company Super
fails to make payment according to the contractual deadline of October 31, 2014. In the tax
declaration period of October 2014, company Super itself already declared reductions of
credited input VAT amount under regulations and concurrently declared increases in
expenses for calculation of enterprise income tax equivalent to the non-creditable input VAT
amount.

In April 2015, the tax office issues a decision on VAT inspection at company Super. For
value-added invoices on goods purchased in February and March 2014, under contracts
on deferred payment which is due on October 31, 2014, the inspection team recognizes the
tax amount that the company declared and credited under regulations.

In May 2015, the tax office issues a decision on VAT handling at company Super (the
decision does not include the handling of VAT on the value-added invoices of goods
purchased in February and March 2014 under contracts on deferred payment which is due
on October 31, 2014, as the inspection team already recognized reductions in accounting
figures).

In December 2015, company Super has via-bank payment documents for the value-added
invoices on goods purchased in February and March 2014 under contracts on deferred
payment that is due on October 31, 2014, it may make additional VAT declaration and
concurrently make corresponding reductions in expenses in calculating enterprise income tax.

Example 66:
Limited Liability Company YKK has the following situation:

Company YKK has value-added invoices for goods purchased in March and April 2014 under
contracts on deferred payment that is due on September 30, 2014. Based on the value-
added invoices provided by the seller, company YKK already declared VAT credit in the
tax declaration papers of March and April 2014. When the payment is due on September 30,
2014, company YKK neither pays nor declares to make reductions. By December 31, 2014,
company YKK fails to declare the reductions of credited value-added amount without via-
bank payment documents.

In April 2015, the tax office issues a decision on VAT inspection at company YKK and the
period under inspection is 2014. At the time of inspection, company YKK fails to produce via-
bank payment documents for value-added invoices under contracts on deferred payment that
is due on September 30, 2014. The inspection team disapproves company YKK’s declaration
for VAT credit for invoices without via-bank payment documents.

In May 2015, the tax office issues a decision on retrospective collection of VAT amounts at
company YKK.

In case in October 2015, company YKK can produce via-bank payment documents for value-
added invoices for goods purchased in March 2014 under contracts for deferred payment that
is due in September 2014, the company may make additional VAT declaration because the
time of producing via-bank payment documents is within six months since the tax office
issues the decision on retrospective tax collection.

In case in December 2015, company YKK can produce via-bank payment documents for
value-added invoices for goods purchased in April 2014 under contracts for deferred payment


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 38 ---
that is due on September 30, 2014, the company may not make additional VAT declaration
because the time of producing via-bank payment documents is beyond six months since the
tax office issues the decision on retrospective tax collection.

Example 67:

In September 2014, the Taxation Department of province B issues a decision on handling of
tax and administrative violations committed by Joint- Stock Company PNG after inspecting
the observance of tax laws. The decision stipulates retrospective collection of the refunded
VAT amount of VND 460 million which is VAT on purchased goods and services worth VND
20 million or higher, and the via-bank payment documents of the dossier with refunded tax
amounts for the period from August 2013 to August 2014 are unavailable at the time of
inspection when the contractual payment time is overdue. Joint-Stock Company PNG has
fully paid the tax amount to the state budget.

In October 2014, Joint-Stock Company PNG produces via-bank payment documents for
invoices for goods purchased under contracts that payment is overdue with the VAT amount
of VND 460 million already collected by the tax office in October 2014, the company may
make additional declaration for adjustment under regulations.

4. Other cases of non-cash payment for input VAT credit include:

a/ For goods and services purchased by clearing their value against that of sold goods and
services or by goods borrowing, which is specified in the contract, there must be a written
record of comparison of figures certified by the two parties of such clearing or borrowing. In
case of debt clearing through a third party, there must be a written record of debt clearing by
the three (3) parties as a basis for tax credit.

b/ For goods and services purchased by debt clearing such as money borrowing and lending
or debt clearing through a third party, which is specified in the contract, there must be a
borrowing and lending contract established in writing earlier and a document on money
transfer from the lender’s account to the borrower's, for a money loan, including also the
case of clearing the value of purchased goods and services against the amount the seller
supports the buyer or asks the buyer to make payment on its behalf.

c/ In case purchased goods and services are paid for via bank by an authorized third party
(including also the case in which the seller requests the buyer to make via-bank payment to a
third party designated by the seller), the payment to the third party authorized or designated
by the seller must be specified in a written contract and the third party must be a legal person
or entity currently operating in accordance with law.

In case after the above methods of payment are applied and the remaining value of VND 20
million or higher is paid in cash, tax may be credited only upon availability of via-bank
payment documents. When declaring input value-added invoices, business establishments
shall clearly write the methods of payment specified in the contracts in the note section of the
list of invoices and documents of purchased goods and services.

d/ In case purchased goods and services are paid for via bank into the third party's account at
the State Treasury to implement coercive measures of collecting money, input VAT may be
credited for property being held by other organizations and individuals (under competent state
agencies’ decisions).

Example 68:

Company A buys goods from company B and company A still owes company B. However,
company B still owes tax to the state budget. Based on the Tax Administration Law, the tax
office enforces a decision on tax administration by collecting company B’s money and
property being held by company A. Company A’s money transfer to the budget collection
account is considered via-bank payment and the input VAT amount corresponding to the
purchased goods turnover may be declared and credited.

Example 69:

Company C signs an economic contract on goods supply with company D and the latter owes
money to company C.


--- PAGE BREAK ---

--- PAGE 39 ---
The competent state agency's decision on the collection of the whole money amount that
company D owes company C for transfer to an account of the competent state agency
opened at the State Treasury aims to settle disputes over the goods purchase contract
between company C and its partner.

Company D’s money transfer to the competent state agency's account (this transfer is not
specified in the purchase and sale contract between company C and company D) is also
considered via-bank payment, and the input VAT amount corresponding to the goods
purchase turnover may be declared and credited.

5. In case a goods or service valued at less than VND 20 million is purchased from a supplier
several times on a day with a total purchase value of VND 20 million or higher, VAT may be
credited only for via-bank payments with supporting documents. The supplier must be a VAT
payer possessing a tax identification number and directly declaring and paying VAT.

In the above example, in January, February and March 2014, enterprise B has input VAT
amounts not fully credited to be carried forward to April 2014 for credit. In April 2014,
enterprise B has a payable tax amount of VND 10 million. In May 2015, it again has an input
VAT amount not fully credited. For 12 months from May 2014 to April 2015, enterprise B still
has an accumulated input VAT amount not fully credited so it is entitled to a VAT refund not
exceeding VND 180 million.

Example 73. Enterprise C declares on a quarterly basis input and output VAT amounts as

In March 2014, the VAT declaration form of enterprise X has the following statistics:
- VAT amount carried forward from the previous period: VND 0.15 billion.

- Input VAT amount for export and taxable domestic business activities arising in the month:
VND 4.8 billion.

- Total turnover is VND 21.6 billion, including VND 13.2 billion in export turnover and VND 8.4
billion in taxable domestic turnover.

Percentage of export turnover/total turnover = 13.2/21.6 x 100% = 61%
- Output VAT amount for goods and services sold domestically is VND 0.84 billion.
The monthly refundable VAT amount for exported goods shall be determined as follows:

VAT amount not
fully credited of = VND 0.84 billion - VND (0.15 + 4.8) billion = - VND 4.11 billion
the month

So, the VAT amount not fully credited of the month is VND 4.11 billion.
- Determination of the input VAT amount for exported goods
Input VAT amount for exported goods = VND 4.11 billion x 61%

= VND 2.507 billion

The input VAT amount for exported goods (after being cleared and distributed) not fully
credited is VND 2.507 billion, which is larger than (>) VND 300 million, so the business
establishment is entitled to a VAT refund of VND 2.507 billion for the month/quarter. The input
VAT amount for domestically sold goods and services, which is not entitled to refund on a
monthly basis, is VND 1.603 billion (VND 1.603 billion = VND 4.11 billion - VND 2.507 billion)
and will be carried forward to the subsequent period for credit.

Example 83:

In March 2014, the VAT declaration of commercial import-export enterprise X has the
following statistics:

VND 4.8 billion.

- Total turnover is VND 21.6 billion, including VND 13.2 billion in export turnover and VND 8.4
billion in taxable domestic turnover.

- Output VAT amount for domestically sold goods and services is VND 840 million.

- Value of input VAT-inclusive goods inventories at the end of March 2014 is VND 10 billion,
equivalent to the declared and credited input VAT amount of VND 1 billion (tax rate of 10%)

The monthly refundable VAT amount for exported goods shall be determined as follows:

VAT amount not fully credited _ VND 840 million - (VND 200 million + VND 4,800 million)
of the month 7 - VND 4.160 million

The input VAT amount to be credited after deducting the input VAT amount for goods and
material inventories is:

VND 4,160 million - VND 1,000 million = VND 3,160 million
- Determination of the input VAT amount for exported goods

credited is VND 1,927.6 million, which is larger than (>) than VND 300 million, so the
business is entitled to a VAT refund of VND 1,927.6 million for the month/quarter. The input
VAT amount for domestically sold goods and services and inventories which is not entitled to
refund on a monthly basis, is VND 2,232.4 million (VND 2,232.4 million = VND 4,160 million -
VND 1,927.6 million) and will be carried forward to the subsequent period for credit.
