method of tax calculation directly on the basis of added value shall not be permitted to deduct VAT in

1. VAT-taxableturnover
(a) VAT-taxable turnover:
VAT-taxable turnover shall be the total turnover from provision of services or services
associated with goods subject to VAT receivable by the foreign contractor or sub-contractor,
without any deduction of payable taxes, including expenses (if any) paid by the Vietnamese
party on behalf of suchforeign contractor or sub-contractor.
(b) Determining VAT-taxable turnoverin some specific cases

include payable VAT as agreed in the contractor's or sub-contractor's contract, then the
VAT-taxable turnover shall be converted into turnover including VAT according to the
following formula:
VAT-taxable VAT-exclusive turnover
turnover = 1 -Percentage(%)of turnover for calculation of VAT
Example11:
Contractor A provides a Vietnamese party with services of supervising the construction
volume of Cement Plant Z with a contract price excluding VAT (but including CIT) being
USD300,000. In addition, the Vietnamese party arranges accommodation and a
working place for managers of Contractor A valued at USD40,000 excluding VAT.

(b).2 Where a foreign contractor signs a contract with either a Vietnamese or foreign sub-
contractor paying tax in accordance with the declaration method or a foreign sub-
contractor paying tax in accordance with a mixed method in order to transfer part or item
of the work of the former contractor's contract signed with the Vietnamese party to such
sub-contractor and a list of Vietnamese sub-contractors and foreign sub-contractors

Where a foreign contractor signs contracts with suppliers in Vietnam for the purchase of
raw materials, machinery and equipment for performance of the foreign contractor's
contract and goods and services for internal consumption or consumption of articles
which are not for items of the work that the foreign contractor performs under the foreign
contractor's contract, the value of such goods and services shall not be excluded upon
calculation of VAT-taxable turnover of the foreign contractor.
Example12:
Foreign Contractor A signs a contract with a Vietnamese party for the construction of
Cement Plant Z with a total contract value (including VAT) of USD10 million. Pursuant to
the contractor's contract, Foreign Contractor A will assign the value of construction and
installation (set out in the contractor's contract signed with the Vietnamese party) to

contract, Foreign Contractor A purchases supplies and raw materials (bricks, cement,
sand etc.) for construction and installation and goods and services such as hire of
vehicles and of hotels for experts or office stationary etc. serving the performance of the
contract.
In this case, the VAT-taxable turnover of Foreign Contractor A shall be calculated as
follows:
VAT-taxable turnover = USD10million-USD1million = USD9 million.
The VAT-taxable turnover of Foreign Contractor A shall not exclude the supplies, raw
materials, goods and services such as hire of vehicles and of hotels for experts or
stationaryetc..
(b).3 Where a foreign contractor signs a contract with a foreign sub-contractor paying tax in
accordance with the rate fixing method, then the Vietnamese party shall declare and pay
VAT on behalf of the foreign contractor or the foreign sub-contractor at a percentage(%)
of turnover for calculation of VAT applicable to the business line which such foreign
contractor or foreign sub-contractor performs [the work] under the contractor's contract

declare and pay VAT on the value of the work which it performs under the sub-
contractor's contract signed with the foreign contractor and for which the Vietnamese
party has declared and paid [tax] on behalf [of such sub-contractor].

turnover shall be the total rent. If turnover from the lease includes costs directly paid by
the lessor such as insurance of means of transportation, maintenance, certification of
registration of means and persons operating means of transportation or machinery, and
costs of bringing such machineryand equipment into Vietnam from overseas, then VAT-
taxable turnover shall exclude such costs if there are documents proving actual
expenditure.
(b).5 In the case of services being international freight forwarding services from Vietnam to
overseas countries (regardless of whether the sender or recipient pays a service
charge), VAT-taxable turnover shall be the whole turnover receivable by the foreign
contractor but not including international transport charges payable to the aviation or
sea transportation firm.
(b).6 In the case of international delivery services from Vietnam to overseas countries
(regardless of whether the sender or recipient pays a service charge), VAT-taxable

countries (regardless of whether the sender in Vietnam or the recipient abroad

+ With respect to the delivery services from overseas countries to Vietnam
(regardless of whether the sender abroad or the recipient in Vietnam pays the
service charge), the amount of USD receivable by Company C shall not be
included in VAT-taxable turnover.
+ With respect to the delivery services from Vietnam to overseas countries
(regardless of whether the sender in Vietnam or the recipient abroad pays the
service charge), the amount of USD receivable by Company C shall be included

2. Percentage(%) of turnover for calculation of VAT:
(a) Percentage(%) of turnover for calculation of VATapplicable to the following business lines:
No. Business lines Percentage (%) for
calculation of VAT
1 Services, machinery and equipment leasing business, 5
and insurance; construction and assembly and
installation where the tender did not include supply of
materials, machinery and equipment
2 Production, transportation, services attached to goods; 3
construction and assembly and installation where the
tender included supply of materials, machinery and
equipment
3 Other business activities 2
(b) Determining a percentage (%) of turnover for calculation of VAT in a number of other specific
cases:
(b).1 Where a contractor's or sub-contractor's contract comprises different business activities
or where a part of the contract value is not subject to VAT, then application of a
percentage of turnover for calculation of VAT when fixing the amount of VAT payable
shall depend on the VAT taxable turnover from each business activity which the foreign
contractor or sub-contractor performs in accordance with such contractor's or sub-
contractor's contract. If the value of each activity cannot be separated, then the highest
percentage of turnover for calculation of VAT applicable to a business line shall apply to
the whole of the contract value.
With respect to construction or installation activities where the tender included supply of
materials, machinery and equipment associated with the construction work, if the
contractor's contract separates out the value of each business activity, the foreign
contractor shall not be liable to pay VAT on the value of raw materials or machinery and
equipment for which VAT is already paid at the import stage or which is not subject to
VAT; and with respect to each part of the remaining value of contractual work, a
percentage (%) of turnover for calculation of VAT applicable to such business activity
shall apply. Where the contractor's contract does not separate out the value of each
business activity, the applicable percentage of turnover for calculation of VAT shall be
3% of the total contract value (including the value of raw materials or machinery and
equipment imported). Where a foreign contractor signs contracts with sub-contractors to
transfer all value of the work or item including supply of raw materials or machinery and
equipment while the foreign contractor only implements the value of the remaining
services in accordance with the contractor's contract, the percentage for calculation of
VAT applicable to the line of business of services shall be 5%.
Example 15:
Foreign Contractor A signs a contract with a Vietnamese party for construction of Power
Plant Xwith the value of USD75 million (including VAT).
Case 1: The contractor's contract can separate out the value of each business activity
as follows:
+ Value of machinery and equipment supplied to the work: USD50 million.
Allens -Vietnam LawsOnline Database on www.vietnamlaws.com 14
Of which:
The value of machinery and equipment subject to VAT: USD30 million.
The value of machinery and equipment which is not subject to VAT: USD15
million.
The value of warranty services associated with the machinery and equipment:
USD5 million
+ Value of design of technological line and other designs: USD5 million.
+ Value of buildings and other support systems, construction and installation:
USD15 million.
+ Value of services of supervising and guiding installation: USD3 million.
+ Value of services of technical training and commissioning: USD2 million.
Upon import, the value of machinery and equipment for which VAT has been paid at the
import stage is USD30 million; and the value of machinery and equipment which is not
subject to VAT is USD15 million.
The VAT obligation of Foreign Contractor A in respect of the value of the contract signed
with the Vietnamese Party shall be calculated only on the value of services and the
value of construction and installation. Thus, the value of services (warranty services,
design services, services of supervising and guiding installation and services of
technical training and commissioning) is USD15 million and is subject to the percentage
of turnover for calculation of VAT applicable to the business line of services being 5%;
and the value of construction and installation is USD15 million and is subject to the
percentage (%) of turnover for calculation of VAT applicable to construction and
installation activities being 3% (excluding VAT on the value of machinery and equipment
imported).
Case 2: The contractor's contract does not separate out the value of each business
activity and only provides the contract value comprising machinery, equipment, design
services, services of supervising and guiding installation and services of technical
training and commissioning. If there are insufficient source documents provingthat VAT
has been paid at the import stage for the value of machinery and equipment supplied to
the works, the VAT obligation of Foreign Contractor A in respect of the value of the
contract signed with the Vietnamese Party shall be calculated on the total value of the
contractor's contract being USD75 million and is subject to the percentage (%) for
calculation of VAT being 3%.
Case 3: Where Foreign Contractor A signs contracts with sub-contractors to transfer
parts of the work including supply of raw materials while Foreign Contractor A only
performs the value of services (such as services for supervising and guiding
installation), the percentage (%) of turnover for calculation of VAT being 5% shall apply
to the value of such services.
(b).2 In the case of a contract for the supply of machinery and equipment accompanied by
services performed in Vietnam, if it is possible to separate out the value of the
Allens -Vietnam LawsOnline Database on www.vietnamlaws.com 15
machinery and equipment from the value of the services when determining the amount
of VAT payable, then a percentage of turnover for calculation of VAT shall apply to each
part of the contract value. If the contract does not separate out the value of each of the
two activities referred to above, the percentage (%) of turnover for calculation of VAT
being 3%shall apply.
Example16:
Foreign Contractor H of Korea, which has not adopted the Vietnamese accounting system, performs
a contract signed with Enterprise B in Vietnam to supply a machinery and equipment production line
accompanied by services being installation, operation and commissioning with a value of USD10
million. The contract does not separate the value of the machinery and equipment from the value of
such services, and accordingly the percentage (%) for calculation of VAT being 3% shall apply.
3. VAT in respect of foreign contractor and foreign sub-contractors providinggoods and services for the
purpose of conducting operations being prospecting, exploration, development and exploitation of oil
and gas fields:
(a) Where a foreign contractor or foreign sub-contractor providing goods and services for the
purpose of conducting operations being prospecting, exploration, development and
exploitation of oil and gas fields fails to satisfy any one of the conditions set out in article 8 of
Section 2 of Chapter II, the Vietnamese party shall be response to withhold and pay VAT on
behalf of [such foreign contractor or foreign sub-contractor] before making payment. The tax
amount payable on behalf of [such foreign contractor or foreign sub-contractor] shall be the
total amount of the payment excluding VAT multiplied by the appropriate VAT rate applicable
to the goods and services provided by the foreign contractor.
(b) Where a foreign contractor or foreign sub-contractor providing goods and services for the
purpose of conducting operations being prospecting, exploration, development and
exploitation of oil and gas fields satisfies three conditions set out in article 8 of Section 2 of
Chapter II or two conditions set out in clauses 1 and 2 of article 8 of Section 2 of Chapter II
and conducts cost accounting in accordance with the law on accounting and guidelines of the
Ministry of Finance:
- Pendinga tax registration certificate issued by the tax authority to theforeign contractor or
foreign sub-contractor for declaration and payment of VAT in accordance with the tax
credit method, if the Vietnamese party makes a payment to the foreign contractor or
foreign sub-contractor, it shall be responsible to withhold and pay VAT on behalf of [such
foreign investor or foreign sub-contractor] before making the payment. The tax amount
payable on behalf of [such foreign contractor or foreign sub-contractor] shall be the total
amount of the payment excluding VAT multiplied by the appropriate VAT rate applicable
tothe goods and services provided by the foreign contractor.
- When the foreign investor or foreign sub-contractor is issued with a tax registration
certificate by the tax authority, the foreign contractor or the foreign sub-contract shall
forward invoices and source documents arising in the VAT declaration period to the
Vietnamese party for the latter to withhold and pay VAT on behalf of the foreign contractor
or foreign sub-contractor.
The foreign contractor or foreign sub-contractor shall not be permitted to deduct input
VAT arising before issuance of a tax registration certificate.

Example 17:
In January 2015 Foreign Contractor A signs a contract with a Vietnamese party for
provision of petroleum services with the contract value of USD1 million. Pending a tax
registration certificate issued by the tax authority to Foreign Contractor A, Foreign
Contractor A generates an amount of input VAT in respect of goods and services
purchased for implementation of the contract being USD5,000. On 15 March 2015, the
Vietnamese Party makes a payment with a value of USD100,000 (excluding VAT and
including CIT) to Foreign Contractor A. The Vietnamese Party is responsible to declare
and pay VAT on behalf of Foreign Contractor A and the amount of VAT is calculated as
follows: USD100,000 x10% = USD10,000.
On 1 May 2015, Foreign Contractor A registers with and is issued with a tax registration
certificate by the tax authority. In May 2015 the Vietnamese Party makes a payment with
a value of USD200,000 (excluding VAT and including CIT) to Foreign Contractor A. Thus,
output VAT of Foreign Contractor A arising in May is USD20,000 (USD200,000 x 10%).
The output VAT of Foreign Contractor A arising from 1 May 2015 to 30 May 2015 is
USD2,000 (VAT arising in the period when Foreign Contractor A has a tax code). Foreign
Contractor A will forward all invoices and source documents arising in May 2015 to the
Vietnamese Party for the latter to declare and pay VAT on behalf of Foreign Contractor A.
The amount of VAT which Foreign Contractor A is liable to pay for the VAT declaration
period for May 2015is USD18,000 = (USD20,000 –USD2,000).
Foreign Contractor A shall not be permitted to deduct USD5,000 of input VAT arising
before 1 May 2015.
Article 13 CIT
The bases for tax calculation shall be CIT-taxable income and CIT rates as a percentage (%) of taxable
turnover.
Amount of = CIT-taxable turnover x CIT rate as a percentage (%)
CIT payable of taxable turnover.
1. CIT-taxable turnover
(a) CIT-taxable turnover
CIT-taxable turnover shall be total turnover excluding VAT, receivable by the foreign contractor
or sub-contractor without deduction of any taxes payable. CIT-taxable turnover shall include
costs (if any) which the Vietnamese party has paid on behalf of suchcontractor or foreign sub-
contractor.
(b) Determining CIT-taxable turnoverin some specific cases
(b).1 Where pursuant to the contractor's or sub-contractor's contract, turnover receivable by
the foreign contractor or sub-contractor excludes payable CIT, then the CIT-taxable
turnover shall be calculated according to the following formula:
Allens -Vietnam LawsOnline Database on www.vietnamlaws.com 17
Turnover excluding CIT
CIT-taxable turnover = ______________________________
1 - CIT rate as percentageof taxable turnover
Example18:
Foreign contractor A provides a Vietnamese party with the service of supervising the
construction volume of Cement Plant Z withthe contract price excluding VAT and CIT of
USD285,000. In addition, the Vietnamese party arranges accommodation and a
working place for managers of the foreign contractor valued at USD38,000 (excluding
VAT and CIT). Pursuant to the contract, the Vietnamese party is responsible to pay CIT
and VAT on behalf of the foreign contractor. The amount of CIT payable by the foreign
contractor shall be calculated as follows:
Calculation of taxable turnover:
CIT-taxable = 285,000 + 38,000 = USD340,000
turnover (1 –5%)
(b).2 If a foreign contractor signs a contract with either a Vietnamese or foreign sub-
contractor paying tax in accordance with the declaration method or a foreign sub-
contractor paying tax in accordance with a mixed method in order to transfer part of the
work or items of the work of the contractor's contract signed with the Vietnamese party
and a list of Vietnamese sub-contractors and foreign sub-contractors implementing their
respective parts or items of the work is attached to such contractor's contract, then CIT-
taxable turnover of such foreign contractor shall not include the value of the work to be
implemented by such Vietnamese or foreign sub-contractor.
Where a foreign contractor signs contracts with suppliers in Vietnam for the purchase of
supplies, raw materials, machinery and equipment for implementation of the contractor's
contract and goods and services for internal consumption or consumption of articles
which are not for items of the work that the foreign contractor performs under the
contractor's contract, the value of such goods and services shall not be excluded upon
calculation of CIT-taxable turnover of the foreign contractor.
Example19:
Foreign Contractor A signs a contract with a Vietnamese party for the construction of
Cement Plant Z with a total contract value (excluding VAT) of USD9 million. Pursuant to
the contractor's contract, Foreign Contractor A will assign part of the value of
construction and installation (set out in the contractor's contract signed with the
Vietnamese party) to Vietnamese Sub-contractor B for a price of USD1 million
(excluding VAT); in addition, during construction of Cement Plant Z for performance of
the contractor's contract, Foreign Contractor A purchases supplies and raw materials
(bricks, cement, sand etc.) for construction and installation and goods and services such
as hire of vehicles and of hotels for experts or office stationary serving the performance
of the contract.
CIT-taxable turnoverof foreign contractor A shall be determined as follows:
CIT-taxableturnover = USD9 million–USD1million = USD8 million.
The CIT-taxable turnover of Foreign Contractor A shall not exclude the supplies, raw
Allens -Vietnam LawsOnline Database on www.vietnamlaws.com 18
materials, goods and services such as hire of vehicles and of hotels for experts or
purchase of office stationary.
(b).3 Where a foreign contractor signs a contract with a foreign sub-contractor paying tax in
accordance with the rate fixing method, then the Vietnamese party shall pay CIT on
behalf of the foreign contractor or the foreign sub-contractor at an appropriate CIT rate
as a percentage (%) of taxable turnover applicable to the business line conducted by
such foreign contractor or foreign sub-contractor under the contractor's contract or the
sub-contractor's contract. The foreign sub-contractor shall not be required to pay CIT on
the value of the work which it performs in accordance with the provisions in the sub-
contractor's contract signed with the foreign contractor and for which the Vietnamese
party has declared and paid [tax] of behalf of [such foreign sub-contractor].
(b).4 With respect tolease of machinery, equipment and means of transportation, CIT-taxable
turnover shall be the total rent. If turnover from the lease of machinery, equipment and
means of transportation includes costs directly paid by the lessor such as insurance of
means of transportation, maintenance, certification of registration of means and persons
operating means of transportation or machinery, and costs of bringing such machinery
and equipment into Vietnam from overseas, then CIT-taxable turnover shall exclude
such costs if there are documents proving actualexpenditure.
(b).5 With respect to foreign airline carriers, CIT-taxable turnover shall be turnover from sale
of passenger tickets and air freight bills of lading and other income (excluding income
collected on behalf of the State or other organizations pursuant to law) in Vietnam for
transportation of passengers, cargo and other objects on flights of such foreign airline
carrier conducted directly or in partnership.
Example20:
In the first quarter of year 2013, foreign airline A generates turnover of USD100,000,
comprising turnover from sales of passenger tickets at USD85,000, air freight bills of
lading of USD10,000, and sales of MCO2 tickets of USD5,000; at the same time it
collects USD1,000 being airport charges on behalf of the State, and refunds USD2,000
to customers who handed in their tickets.
CIT-taxable turnover of foreign airline A for the first quarter of 2013 shall be determined
as follows:
CIT-taxableturnover = 100,000–(1,000 + 2,000) = USD97,000.
(b).6 With respect to foreign sea transport firms, CIT-taxable turnover shall be the total
amount of fees (including any additional fees) receivable for transporting passengers
and cargo from loading ports in Vietnam to the final port of discharge or disembarkation
(including fees for transferring consignments of goods between intermediate ports)

(b).7 In the case of international freight forwarding services from Vietnam to overseas
countries (regardless of whether the sender or the recipient pays the service charge),
CIT-taxable turnover shall be the whole turnover receivable by the foreign contractor
excluding international transport fees payable to the aviation or sea transportation firm.
(b).8 In the case of international delivery services from Vietnam to overseas countries
(regardless of whether the sender or the recipient pays the service charge), CIT-taxable
turnover shall be the total turnover receivable by the foreign contractor.

Example 24:
Bank A (A) provides a loan of USD10 million at a fixed rate of interest being 5.2% per
annum. The term of the [loan] agreement is three years from 1 February 2012 to 1
February 2015. Payments will be made once every six months at the beginning of each
period of six months.
Based on the loan agreement of A, A enters into negotiation with Bank B (B) abroad in
order to implement an interest rate swap contract, specifically:
- The term of the [loan] agreement is three years from 1 February 2012 to 1
February 2015. Payments will be made once every six months at the beginning
of each period of six months.
- The floating rate of interest payable by A to B is LIBOR plus 0.25% and B must
pay A at the fixed rate of interest being 5.2%. This means that if LIBOR plus
0.25% is higher than the fixed rate of interest under the swap contract, B will
receive a difference between interest (at the LIBOR plus 0.25%) and interest
payable at the rate of interest being 5.2% from A. Otherwise, if LIBOR plus
0.25% is lower than the fixed rate of interest under the swap contract, A will
receive a difference between interest at the rate of 5.2% and interest receivable

it must pay USD5,000 to B (taxable turnover is zero);
- Year 2015: Because payments are made at the beginning of each period of
payment, no offset between A and B arises.
(b).12In the case of treasury bills:

The weighted average purchase price of the number of treasury bills held by the
investor at the due date shall be calculated in accordance with the following three steps:
Step 1: Determining the quantity of treasury bills held at the due date.
Step 2: Determining the quantity, date of purchase and respective purchase prices of
treasury bills held at the due date (which are determined in Step 1) on the principle that
the first treasury bills purchasedare the first ones sold (FIFO principle).
Allens -Vietnam LawsOnline Database on www.vietnamlaws.com 22
Step 3: Calculating the weighted average purchase price in accordance with the
following formula:
=∑(quantity of treasury bills held at the due date at the dates of purchase (x) multiplied
by their respective purchase price at the dates of purchase) (÷) divided by quantity of
treasury bills held at the due date
Example 25:
On 1 January 2015, treasurybills X with a face value of 100,000 dong and a term of six
months are issued at the price of 89,000 dong per treasury bill. Immediately after issue,
the treasury bills are listed and traded on HNX. Investor A conducts a number of
transactions from 2 January to 1 July 2015 (due date):
Date of trading Purchase/ Sale Volume Price
2January 2015 Purchase 100 90,000
1February 2015 Purchase 100 92,000
1March 2015 Sale 70 93,000
1April 2015 Purchase 40 94,000
1May 2015 Sale 20 95,000
Step 1: Determining the quantity of treasury bills held at the due date: (100 + 100 + 40)
–(70 + 20) = 150 treasury bills
Step 2: Determining the quantity, date of purchase and respective purchase prices of
treasury bills held at the due date after deduction of the quantity of treasury bills sold on
occasions, on the principle that the first treasury bills purchased are the first ones sold
(FIFO principle) comprising: 150 treasury bills held at the due date comprising:
+ 10 treasury bills purchased at the price of 90,000 on 2 January 2015.
+ 100 treasury bills purchased at the price of 92,000 on 1 February 2015.
+ 40 treasury bills purchased at the price of 94,000 on 1 April 2015.
Sep 3: Calculating the weighted average purchase price in accordance with the
following formula:
Weighted average purchase price of treasury bills: [(40 x 94,000 + 100 x 92,000 + 10 x
90,000)/ 150] = 92,400(dong)
CIT-taxable turnover in respect of the quantity of treasury bills receivable by the investor
at the due date: (100,000 –92,400) x 150 = 1,140,000 (dong).

(b) CIT rates as a percentage (%) of taxable turnoverin some specific cases
(b).1 For the purpose of calculating the amount of CIT payable on a contractor's or sub-
contractor's contract for a number of different business activities, CIT rates shall be
applied on the basis of the CIT-taxable turnover from each business activity performed
by the foreign contractor or sub-contractor under the contract. Where the value of each
business activity is not able to be calculated separately, the CIT rate for the line of
business which is subject to the highest tax rate shall apply to the total value of the
contract.
With respect to construction or installation activities with supply of raw materials or
machinery and equipment associated with the construction work, if the contractor's
contract can separate out the value of each business activity, each part of the value of
the work under the contract shall be subject to the CIT rate as a percentage (%) of the
turnover applicable to such business activity. If the contractor's contract does not
separate out the value of each business activity, the CIT rate as a percentage of the
taxable turnover shall be 2% of the total contract value. Where a foreign contractor
signs contracts with sub-contractors to transfer all value of the work or items of the work
with supply of raw materials or machinery and equipment while the foreign contractor
only implements the value of the remaining services in accordance with the contractor's
contract, then the CIT rate as a percentage of the CIT-taxable turnover applicable to the
line of business of services shall be 5%.
Allens -Vietnam LawsOnline Database on www.vietnamlaws.com 24
Example 26:
Foreign Contractor A signs a contract with a Vietnamese party for construction of Power
Plant X with the value of USD75 million (including VAT, but including CIT). The contract
value comprises:
Case 1: The contractor's contract can separate each business activity as follows:
+ Value of machinery and equipment supplied to the work: USD50 million.
Of which:
The value of machinery and equipment: USD45 million
The value of warranty services associated with the machinery and equipment:
USD5 million
+ Value of design of technological line and other designs: USD5 million.
+ Value of buildings and other support systems, construction and installation:
USD15 million.
+ Value of services of supervising and guiding installation: USD3 million.
+ Value of services of technical training and commissioning: USD2 million.
Thus, the applicable CIT rates as a percentage are as follows: 1% for the value of
machinery and equipment of USD45 million, 2% for the value of construction and
installation of USD15 million; and 5% for the value of other services (services of
warranty, design, supervising and guiding installation and services of technical training
and commission) of USD15 million.
Case 2: The contractor's contract does not separate each business activity. Thus, the
applicable CIT rate as a percentage of the whole contract value of USD75 million is 2%.
Case 3: Where Foreign Contractor A signs contracts with sub-contractors to transfer
parts of the work including supply of raw materials while Foreign Contractor A only
performs the value of services (such as services for supervising and guiding
installation), the value of such services shall be subject to the CIT rate of 5%.
(b).2 In the case of contracts for supply of machinery and equipment associated with services
performed in Vietnam, where the value of the machinery and equipment is separable
from the value of the services, then tax shall be assessed as the percentage applicable
to each activity. If the contract does not separate the value of the machinery and
equipment from the value of the services, then the CIT rate of 2% shall apply to the
taxable turnover.
