The selection of revenue from lump-sum payment is only determined after the enterprise has fulfilled every financial responsibility with the State, ensuring the duties with the lessee until the land lease period expires.If an enterprise enjoying enterprise income tax incentives selects the method for determining revenue for calculating taxable income being the total rent paid in advance for many years by the lessee, the enterprise income tax amount eligible for tax exemption or tax reduction shall be determined based on the total enterprise income tax amount of the years being paid in advance divided by (:) the number of years being paid in advance by the lessee.If before 2012, an enterprise leases out land (paid in advance for many years) and has determined the revenue for tax calculation by distributed to the number of years being paid in advance, and the land lease period is still unexpired in 2012, such enterprise may determine the revenue for tax calculation distributed annually or the revenue from lump-sum payment for the remaining years in the land lease period.- When a credit institutions receives the tenancy value put up as collateral for assuring the duty fulfillment, if the land tenancy put up as collateral is transferred, the revenue for calculating taxable income is the transfer price of the land tenancy agreed by the parties.- When the land tenancy being property distrained for judgment enforcement is transferred, the revenue for calculating taxable income is the transfer price of the land tenancy agreed by the litigants, or determined by the Valuation council.The revenue determination in the cases in Point a.2 must comply with the principles specified in Point a.1.b) Expenses on real estate transferb.1. Principles of expense calculation:- The expenses deducted for calculating the taxable income from real estate transfer in a tax period must be proportional to the revenue for calculating taxable income.- If an investment project is completed and transferred in stages, the general expenses on the entire project, the expense of each completed stage distributed by the area (m2) of land transferred to calculate the taxable income from the land transferred, including: the expenses on internal traffic; tree area, investment in water supply and drainage; transformer station; compensation for property on land; compensation, support, and resettlement, expenses on the organization of land clearance and compensation approved by competent authorities not being deducted from the land levy and land rent according to the policy on the collection of land levy and land rent payable to the State budget, and other investment in land related to the transfer of the right to use or to rent land.The distribution of the expenses above is calculated as follows:The expense distributed to the land transferred = The total cost of infrastructure  x The amount of land transferred    The total amount of land allocated to the project (excluding the public land area as prescribed by law provisions on land)    If part of the project area not being transferred is used for other business activities, the general expenses above are also distributed to such area for monitoring, accounting, declaring and paying enterprise income tax on other business activities.In case an enterprise invests in infrastructural construction for many years and only calculate the value of the infrastructure after all the constructions is done, when calculating the expenses on real estate transfer regarding the land area transferred, the enterprise may temporarily distribute the expenses on investment in infrastructure arising proportionally to the land area transferred using the formula above, and extract the expenses on infrastructure corresponding to the recorded revenue when calculating taxable income. After completing the construction investment, the enterprise shall calculate and adjust the expenses on infrastructure temporarily distributed and extracted for the area transferred consistently with the total value of infrastructure. If the paid tax is higher than the income tax on real estate transfer payable, the enterprise may deduct the excessive tax amount from the tax amount payable of the succeeding period, or get back the excessive tax amount; if the tax is not completely paid, the enterprise must pay the tax arrears as prescribed.b.2. The deductible expenses on real estate transfer include:- The cost price of the land transferred conformable to the land tenancy origin. In particular:+ For the land allocated by the State subject to land levy and land rent, the cost price is the land levy or land rent paid to the State budget;+ For the land tenancy transferred from other organizations and individuals, the cost price is based on the contract and valid payment receipts when receiving the right to use or to rent land; If the contract or valid payment receipts are not available, the cost price shall be calculated based on the price set by provincial People s Committees at the time of receiving real estate transfer.+ For land from capital contribution, the cost price is the value of the right to use or to rent land according to the property valuation record when contributing;+ When an enterprise swaps the construction for the State-owned land, the cost price is calculated based on the value of the construction swapped, except otherwise prescribed by competent State agencies.+ The cost price is the auction winning price if the right to use or to rent land is put up for auction;+ When the land of an enterprise is inherited under civil laws, or given, donated, of which the cost price is not able to be calculated, is shall be determined based on the prices of the kinds of land set by provincial People s Committees based on the Price bracket table of kinds of land made by the Government at the time of inheriting, giving, or donating.+ When the land of an enterprise is inherited, given, or donated before 1994, the cost price shall be determined based on the prices of the kinds of land set by provincial People s Committees in 1994 based on the Price bracket table of kinds of land in the Government's Decree No. 87/CP on August 17, 1994.+ For land put up as collateral, land being distrained property for judgment enforcement, the cost price of land is calculated depending on each specific case as guided above.- The compensation for damage to land.- The compensation for damage to crops.-  The compensation, support and resettlement and expenses on the organization of compensation, support and resettlement as prescribed by law. If the expenses on compensation, support, resettlement, and the expenses on the organization of compensation, support, resettlement stated above have no invoice, then make a List specifying: the names, addresses of the receivers, the compensation and support amount, their signatures. The list must be certified by the local authorities where the land is given compensation and support in accordance with law provisions on compensation, support, and resettlement when the State withdrawing land.- The fees and charges as prescribed by law provisions related to land tenancy grant.- The expenses on land renovation and leveling- The expenses on infrastructural construction such as traffic roads, electricity, water supply and drainage, post and telecommunications - The value of infrastructure and constructions on the land.- Other expenses related to the real estate transferred.If an enterprise carries on various business lines, the expenses must be separately calculated. If the expenses cannot be separately calculated, the general expense shall be distributed based on the ratio of revenue from real estate transfer to the total revenue of the enterprise.The expenses paid by the State or other capital sources must not be included in the expenses on real estate transfer.2. The enterprise income tax rate on real estate transfer is 25%.3. Calculating the enterprise income tax amount payable:The enterprise income tax in the tax period on the real estate transfer equals the chargeable income from real estate transfer multiplied by (x) 25%.The income from real estate transfer must be separately determined to declare and pay tax. The preferential tax rate, the tax exemption or reduction period as prescribed in Chapter VI of this Circular do not apply to the income from real estate transfer.If the real estate transfer makes a loss, such loss must not be offset against the income from other production and business activities, but shall be transferred to the taxable income from the real estate transfer in the succeeding years (if any). The loss transfer period must not be longer than 5 consecutive years as from the year succeeding the loss-making year.The tax declaration and payment dossiers, the income tax payment receipts on the income from real estate transfer in the locality where the real estate is transferred are the basis for tax settlement procedures at the locality where the head office is situated.4. When a credit institution receives the real estate value being collateral for assuring the duty fulfillment, the credit institution must declare and pay tax on the income from real estate transfer to the State budget when it is allowed to transfer real estate as prescribed by law. If real estate being collateral is up for auction, the money collected must be paid as prescribed by the Government s provision on collateral of credit institutions, then declare and pay tax as prescribed. After the amount above are paid, the remaining money shall be refunded to the organizations that put up their real estate as collateral.When a credit institution is allowed to transfer real estate put up as collateral as prescribed by law to recover their capital, if the cost price of the real estate is not determined, it shall equal (=) the loan payable under the real estate collateral contract plus (+) the outstanding loan interest up to the time of real estate collateral liquidation under the credit contract plus (+) the expenses arising during the real estate transfer with valid receipts and invoices.5. If real estate being collateral is up for auction by the judgment enforcement agency, the money collected must comply with the Government s Decree on distraining and putting up land tenancy for auction for judgment enforcement. The organization authorized to hold real estate auctions must declare and deduct the tax on income from real estate transfer paid to the State budget. Specify the tax declaration and payment for the collateral sale for judgment enforcement.When the judgment enforcement agency transfers the real estate being judgment enforcement property, if its cost price is not determined, the cost price shall equal (=) the debt payable under the Court s judgment plus (+) the expenses arising during the real estate transfer with valid receipts and invoices.Chapter VIENTERPRISE INCOME TAX INCENTIVESArticle 18. Conditions and principles for applying enterprise income tax incentives1. The conditions for applying enterprise income tax incentives: enterprise income tax incentives are only applicable to the enterprises following the policies on accounting and invoices as prescribed, and have registered and paid enterprise income tax as declared.2. The principles for applying enterprise income tax incentivesa) While enjoying enterprise income tax incentives, if an enterprise engages in various production and business activities, it must separately calculate the income from the production and business activities eligible for enterprise income tax incentives (including the preferential tax rates, the level of tax exemption and reduction), and the income from business activities ineligible for tax incentives to separately declare and pay tax.During the tax period, if an enterprise does not separately calculate the income from the production and business activities eligible for tax incentives and the income from production and business activities ineligible for tax incentives, the income from the production and business activities eligible for tax incentive equals (=) the total chargeable income (excluding other incomes) multiplied by (x) the ratio (%) of the revenue or deductible expenses of the production and business activities eligible for tax incentives to the total revenue or the total deductible expenses of the enterprise in the tax period.b) Enterprises newly established from the investment projects eligible for enterprise income tax incentives are enterprises that apply for business registration for the first time, excluding the following cases:b.1. Enterprises established from the division, separation, merger and consolidation as prescribed by law.b.2. Enterprises established from the enterprise form conversion, ownership conversion (including the newly-established enterprises that inherit the property, places, business line  of the old enterprises to carry on the production and business activities).b.3. Newly-established limited liability companies, private enterprises of which the owners are the former owners of the individual business households and the business lines are not changed.b.4. Private enterprises, partnership companies, limited liability companies, joint-stock company or cooperatives newly established of which the legal representatives are the biggest contributors that have participated in the business activities as legal representatives, partners, or biggest contributors of the enterprises that have been dissolved within less than 12 months ago as from the time of dissolving the old enterprises until the new enterprises are established.c) Investment projects are the collections of long-term and mid-term capital provision proposals to carry out the investments as prescribed by law provisions on investment.For enterprises newly established from domestic investment projects of which the capital is under fifteen (15) billion VND and not in the List of conditional investment industries, the investment project dossiers are the enterprise registration certificates.For enterprises newly established from domestic investment projects of which the capital is from fifteen (15) to under three hundred (300) billion VND and not in the List of conditional investment industries, the investors shall implement the investment registration procedures using the form of the provincial investment management agencies.3. Enterprise income tax incentives for enterprises newly established from investment projects are only applicable to the income from production and business activities that satisfy the conditions for investment incentives specified in the first Certificate of business registration of the enterprises. When an enterprise changes its Certificate of business registration without affecting the fulfillment of the conditions for tax incentives, such enterprise shall continue enjoying tax incentives for the remaining time. If an enterprise adds more business lines or expand its business scale (such as installing new production lines...), the income from the additional business activities are not eligible for enterprise income tax incentives.4. When an enterprise newly established from an investment project in the locality enjoying investment incentives, it is eligible for enterprise income tax incentives within the investment incentive locality. If its incomes are earned from production and business activities in both the investment incentive locality and a non-incentive locality, it must separately calculate the income earned within the investment incentive locality to enjoy enterprise income tax incentives.5. In the same tax period, if an income is eligible for various preferential enterprise income tax rates, and various tax exemption or reduction periods, the enterprise may select the most beneficial enterprise income tax incentive.6. During the enterprise income tax incentive period, if an enterprise fails to satisfy one of the conditions for tax incentives in a tax-calculation year specified in this Circular, it is not eligible for tax incentives in that tax-calculation year and must pay enterprise income tax at the rate of 25%.7. In case in the same tax period, an enterprise engages in business activities eligible for tax incentives that make losses, business activities ineligible for tax incentives, or earns other incomes from business activities (excluding the incomes from real estate transfer, project transfer (not attached to the transfer of the right to use or to rent land); incomes from the transfer of the right to execute the project, the right to carry out mineral resources exploration, extraction and processing as prescribed by law), the enterprise shall offset them against the taxable income from the profitable activities selected by the enterprise.If an enterprise is making losses in previous tax period (during the loss transfer period), it must transfer the loss proportionally to the profitable activities. If an enterprise fails to separate the loss of each activities, it shall first transfer the loss to the income from the activities eligible for enterprise income tax incentives, then transfer the remaining loss (if any) to the income from activities ineligible for enterprise income tax incentives (excluding the incomes from real estate transfer, project transfer (not attached to the transfer of the right to use or to rent land); incomes from the transfer of the right to execute the project, the right to carry out mineral resources exploration, extraction and processing as prescribed by law). After transferring the loss on the above principles, if various business activities still generate profits or make losses (excluding the incomes from real estate transfer, project transfer (not attached to the transfer of the right to use or to rent land); incomes from the transfer of the right to execute the project, the right to carry out mineral resources exploration, extraction and processing as prescribed by law), the enterprise may offset them against the taxable income from the profitable activities. The remaining income after offsetting shall be subject to the enterprise income tax rate based on the tax rate on the profitable activities.Example 13. In the tax period in 2012, enterprise A has made:- A loss of 1 billion VND on the production of software eligible for tax incentives.- A profit of 1 billion VND on the trading of computers ineligible for tax incentives.- A profit of 2 billion VND on the securities transfer (other incomes from business activities).In this case, enterprise A may offset the loss on software production against the profit on computer trading or the profit on securities transfer; the remaining income is subject to the enterprise income tax rate on the profitable portion.In particular: offset the loss of 1 billion VND on software production against the profit of 1 billion VN D   o n   c o m p u t e r   t r a d i n g   o r   o n   s e c u r i t i e s   t r a n s f e r .   !

Enterprise C must offset the loss against the income from the preferential activity (software production).In particular: Offsetting profits and losses made in 2012: the enterprise may choose to offset the loss on securities trading against the income from computer trading. The remaining profit on computer trading is: 2 billion VND   1 billion VND = 1 billion VND- Transferring the loss made in 2011 to offset against the profit on software production in 2012: 2 billion VND   2 billion VND = 0 billion VNDDeclaring, calculating and paying the enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on the business activities ineligible for tax incentives: 1 billion VND x 25% = 250 million VND.8.
