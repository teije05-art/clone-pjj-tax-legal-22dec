Fixed assets used for business purposes are fixed assets managed and used by enterprises for their business purposes.a) For tangible fixed assets, the enterprises can classify them as follows:Type 1: Housing and structures: are the enterprise s fixed assets formed after the construction process, such as head office, warehousing, fences, water tower, open storage, the works decorating housing, roads, bridges, railways, airfield, piers, wharves, docks and slipway.Type 2: Machinery and equipment: the whole machinery and equipment used in the business operation of the enterprise such as specialized machinery, working equipment, drilling rigs in the oil and gas area, cranes, technological lines and individual machines.Type 3: Means of transport, transmission equipment are types of means of transportation including railway, water way, road, air, pipeline and transmission equipment, such as information system, electrical system, water pipe and conveyor.Type 4: Equipment and management tools: are the equipment and tools used in the management of the enterprise s business operations such as computers for management, electronic equipment, equipment, measurement and quality tools, dehumidifiers, vacuum cleaners, anti-termite.Type 5: Perennial orchards, working animals and / or giving products: are the perennial orchards as coffee plantations, tea plantations, rubber plantations, orchards, lawn, green carpet .. ., working animals and / or giving products, such as herd of elephants, horses, buffaloes, cows ...Type 6: Other types of fixed assets: are all other fixed assets not listed in the above five types such as pictures,.b) Intangible fixed assets: land use rights as stipulated in Clause 2, Article 4 of this Circular, issuance right, patent, inventions, literature, works of art, science, products, results of art performance, video and audio recordings, broadcasting programs, satellite signals carrying coded programs, industrial designs, designs of semiconductor integrated circuits, business secrets, trademarks, trade names and geographical indications, plant varieties and breeding material.2. Fixed assets used for welfare purposes, career, security and national defense are the fixed assets managed and used by enterprises for welfare purposes, career, security and national defense in the enterprises. These fixed assets are also classified under provisions of Point 1 mentioned above.3. Fixed assets preserved, kept or stored are the fixed assets which the enterprises preserve or keep for other units or keep for the State as prescribed by the competent State agencies.4. Depending on the requirements on management of each enterprise, the enterprises shall classify more detailed their types of fixed asset in each group accordingly.Article 7. Investment, upgrade and repair of fixed assets:1. The costs which enterprises have paid for upgrade of fixed assets are reflected by an increase in primary price of such fixed assets. These costs must not be recorded into the cost of business and productions in the period.2. The repair costs of fixed assets must not be calculated by an increase in primary price of fixed assets but are recorded directly or amortized into the business cost in the period, but not exceeding 3 years maximally.For fixed assets whose repair is cyclical, the enterprises shall be allowed for deduction of repair cost by estimating into the annual cost. If the actual cost of repair of fixed assets is greater than the deduction by estimate, the enterprises shall be allowed to include in the rational costs this difference. If the actual cost of repair of fixed assets is less than the deduction, the difference is recorded by a reduction of business costs in the period.3. The costs related to intangible assets generated after initial recognition and evaluated with certainty, increasing the economic benefits of the intangible fixed assets compared to the initial activity, shall be reflected by an increase of primary price cost . Other costs related to intangible assets generated after initial recognition are recorded in cost of business and production. Article 8. Leasing, pledging, mortgaging, sale or disposal:1. All activities of leasing, pledging, mortgaging, sale or disposal of fixed assets must comply with current regulations of law.2. For leased fixed assets:a) Operating fixed assets:- The leased enterprise must have responsibility for management, use of fixed assets under provisions in the lease contract. The leasing cost of fixed assets is recorded into business cost in the period.- The leasing enterprise as the owner must monitor and manage the leased fixed assets.b) For fixed assets from financial leasing:- The leased enterprise must monitor, manage and use the leased fixed assets as they are owned by enterprises and fulfill the obligations committed in the contract of fixed assets leasing.- The leasing enterprise, as an investor shall monitor and comply with the provisions of the contract of fixed assets leasing.c) In case in the contract of asset leasing (including operating leasing and financial leasing) stipulating that the lessee shall repair the assets during the leasing term, the repairment costs of the leased fixed assets shall be recorded in the costs or amortized into the business cost but the time must not exceed 3 years.Chapter III: REGULATION ON DEPRECIATION OF FIXED ASSETSArticle 9. Principles of depreciation of fixed assets:1. All of the enterprise s current fixed assets must be depreciated excluding the following fixed assets:- Fixed assets have been fully depreciated but are still used in production and business activities.- Fixed assets are lost during depreciation.- Other fixed assets managed but not owned by enterprise.- Fixed assets are not managed, monitored and recorded in the enterprise s accounting books.- Fixed assets are used in welfare activities to serve the enterprise s employees (excluding the fixed assets to serve employees working at enterprises such as mid-shift rest house, shift, mid-shit canteen, dressing house, toilet, clean water tank, garage, medical room or station for health examination, the employee shuttle bus, training facilities, vocational training and housing for employees built by enterprise). - Fixed assets from the non-refundable aid after the competent agencies have handed them over to enerprises in service of their scientific research.- Intangible fixed assets are long-term land use right with land use fee or receiving the legal long-term land use right.2. The depreciation of fixed assets included in the rational costs when calculating the Enterprise Income Tax  shall comply with the provisions in the legal documents on enterprise income tax3. In case the fixed assets used in welfare activities to serve the enterprise s employees specified in Clause 1, Article 9 of this Circular are engaged in the production and business activities, the enterprise shall base on the time and unitilization nature of these fixed assets to perform the depreciation in the enterprise s business cost and notify the tax agency directly managing for monitoring and management.4. Fixed assets are lost or damaged during depreciation and may not be repaired or remedied. The enterprises shall determine the cause and responsibility for compensation of the organization or individual causing the loss or damage. The difference between the Residual value of the asset with the compensation of organization or individual causing the loss or damage, the compensation of insurance agency and the value recovered (if any), the enterprises shall use the financial reserve fund for compensation. In case the financial reserve fund is not sufficient for compensation, the enterprises may include the deficit in their rational costs when determining the enterprise income tax5. Enterprises leasing the operating fixed assets must depreciate the leased fixed assets.6. Enterprises leasing the fixed assets in the form of financial leasing (referred to as fixed assets from financial leasing) must depreciate the leased fixed assets as the fixed assets owned by enterprises under the current regulations. In case right at the starting time of asset lease, the enterprise leasing the fixed assets from financial leasing shall commit not to repurchase the leased assets in the contract of financial leasing, the enterprise leasing may depreciate the fixed assets from financial leasing under the leasing term in the contract.7. In case of re-evaluation of value of fixed assets fully depreciated for capital contribution, transfer upon split, consolidation, merger, these assets shall be evaluated by professional evaluation organizations but not lower than 20% of primary price of such assets. The time of depreciation for these assets is the time the enterprises officially take over the assets and put them into use and the time of depreciation is from 3 to 5 years. The specific time shall be decided by the enterprises but they must notify the tax authorities before implementation.For the enterprises implementing equitization, the time of depreciation of the above fixed assets is the time the enterprises are granted the business registration certificates converted into joint stock companies.8. Enterprises with 100% state capital implementing the evaluation of enterprises for equitization by the method of discounted cash flow method (DCF), the increasing difference of the state capital between the actual value and the value in acounting books is not recognized as intangible assets and amortized into the production cost in the period but the time shall not exceed 10 years. The starting time of amortization into the costs is the time the enterprises are officially converted into joint-stock companies (with business registration certificate).9. The depreciation or stoppage of depreciation of fixed assets is implemented from the start date (by a number of days of a month) on which the fixed assets increase or decrease. The enterprises shall record the increase or decrease of fixed assets under current regulations on enterprise accounting system.10. For capital construction works completed and put into use, enterprises have recorded the increase of fixed assets by provisional price due to unrealized settlement. Upon settlement of capital construction works completed with the difference between the provisional value and settlement value, the enterprises shall adjust the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  p r i m a r y   p r i c e   o f   f i x e d   a s s e t s   b y   s e t t l e m e n t   v a l u e       a p p r o v e d   b y   c o m p e t e n t   a u t h o r i t i e s .

T h e   d e p r eciation costs after the settlement time are determined on the basis of taking the settlement value of fixed assets approved minus (-) the number depreciated  the time of settlement approval of fixed assets and divided (: ) by remaining time of depreciation of fixed assets as prescribed.11. For fixed assets monitored, managed and depreciated by enterprises under Circular No. 203/2009/TT-BTC but now ineligible for the primary price of fixed assets in accordance with Article 2 of this Circular, the residual value of these assets shall be amortized into the enterprise s costs of business and production. The time of amortization shall not exceed three years from the effective date of this Circular.Article 10. Determination of time of depreciation of tangible fixed assets :1. For new fixed assets (not used), the enterprises must depend on the time frame of depreciation of fixed assets specified in Appendix 1 issued together with this Circular to determine the time of depreciation of fixed assets.2. For fixed assets used, the time of depreciation of fixed assets is determined as follows:The time of depreciation of fixed assets = Rational value of fixed assets x The time of depreciation of new fixed assets of the same type determined in Annex 1 (issued together with this Circular)    Sale price of fixed assets 100% new of the same type (or of equivalent fixed assets  in the market)    In which: The rational value of fixed assets is the purchase price or actual exchange ( in case of sale and purchase and exchange), the Residual value of the fixed assets or the value by assessment of a valuation organization ( in case of being given, offered, donated, allocated or transferred) and other cases.3. Change of time of depreciation of fixed assets:a) In case the enterprises wish to determine the time of depreciation of other new and used fixed assets compared with the time frame of depreciation as prescribed in Annex 1 issued together with this Circular, they must plan the change of time of depreciation of fixed assets on the basis of clear explanation of the following contents:- Technical life service of fixed assets by design;- Present condition of fixed assets ( time used of fixed assets, asset generation, actual condition of asset);- The impact of the increase or decrease in depreciation of fixed assets on the result of business and repayment capital to credit institutions.- For assets formed from B.O.T and B.C.C investment projects, the enterprises have to supplement the Contract signed with the investors.b) Competence to approve the Plan for change of time of depreciation of fixed assets:- The Ministry of Finance shall approve the Plan in case:+ The parent companies of the economic groups, corporations and state companies holding 51% of the charter capital or more decided to establish by Ministries, sectors and Prime Minister.+ Subsidiaries with their parent company, economic groups and corporations holding 51% of the charter capital or more.- Service of Finance of centrally-affiliated provinces and cities shall approve for Corporations, independent companies established by the People's Committees of centrally-affiliated provinces and cities, the enterprises of other economic sectors having their head offices in the area.On the basis of the Plan for change of time of depreciation of fixed assets approved by the competent authorities, within 20 days after the approval date of the Plan, the enterprises shall notify the directly managing tax agency for monitoring and management.c) Enterprises may change the time of depreciation of fixed assets once for an asset. The extension of time of depreciation of fixed assets shall not exceed the technical life service of fixed assets and does not change the enterprises  business results from the profit to loss or vice versa in the year making a decision on the change. In case the enterprises change the time of depreciation of fixed assets not in accordance with regulation, the Ministry of Finance and directly managing tax agency shall request the enterprises to re-determine the change as prescribed.4. In case of impact factors (such as upgrading or removal of one or several parts of fixed assets) to extend or shorten the utilization time previously determined of the fixed assets, the enterprises shall re-determine the time of depreciation of fixed assets according to the three criteria mentioned above at the time of completion of generated operation and make a record stating the grounds for changing the time of depreciation for submission to the competent authority for decision in accordance with Item b, Clause 3 of this Article.Article 11. Determination of time of depreciation of intangible fixed assets:1. The enterprises shall determine the time of depreciation of intangible fixed assets by themselves but not exceeding 20 years2. For the intangible fixed assets which are the value of land use right with term, the leased land use right. The time of depreciation is the time permitted for land use of enterprises. 3. For the intangible fixed assets which are copyright, intellectual property right, plant variety right, the time of depreciation is the term of protection indicated on the degree of protection as prescribed (excluding the extended term of protection).Article 12. Determination of the time of depreciation of fixed assets in several special cases:1. For investment projects in the form of Build - Operate - Transfer (BOT) and Business Cooperation Contract (BCC), the time of depreciation of fixed assets shall be determined from the time to put the fixed assets into use until the end of the project. In case the above projects have generated irregular revenue in the years of project implementation but the calculation of depreciation on the above principles affects the enterprises  business result, they shall make a report to the Ministry of Finance for consideration of the increase or decrease in depreciation as provided for in Clause 3, Article 10 of this Circular.2. For production lines with military particularity specific and directly involved in tasks of national defense and security in national defense and security companies, based on the provisions of this Circular, the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Public Security shall decide the time frame for depreciation of these assets.Article 13. Method of depreciation of fixed assets:1. Methods of depreciation:a) Straight-line depreciation method.b) Adjusted reducing balance methodc) Method of depreciation based on volume2. Based on the capacity to meet the applicable conditions specified for each method of depreciation of fixed assets, the enterprises may choose method of depreciation appropriate with each type of enterprises  fixed asset:a) The straight-line depreciation method is the method of depreciation by the rate of stability calculation of each year into the enterprises  costs of business and production of the fixed assets involved in the business operation.The enterprises operating with high economic efficiency may accelerate their depreciation, but not more than 2 times of the depreciation rate by the straight-line method for rapid technological innovation. The fixed assets involved in business activities and accelerated their depreciation are machinery and equipment, experimental and measuring instruments, equipment and means of transport, management tools, animals, perennial orchards. When performing accelerated depreciation, the enterprises must ensure profitable business. In case the enterprises accelerate their depreciation exceeding 2 times of the rate specified in time frame for use of fixed assets provided for in Appendix 1 attached to this Circular, the excess of accelerated depreciation (over 2 times) is not included in the reasonable costs upon calculation income tax in the period.b) Adjusted reducing balance method:This method applies to the enterprises in areas with technology requiring rapid changes and development.The fixed assets involved in business operations are depreciated by the adjusted reducing balance method must meet the following conditions:- Being new fixed assets (not used);- Being machinery, equipment, experimental and measuring instruments.c) Method of depreciation based on volume:The fixed assets involved in business operations are depreciated by this method are types of machinery and equipment meeting the following conditions:- Directly related to product making;- Determining the total number and volume of products made by design capacity of fixed assets;- The actual capacity per month in the fiscal year is not less than 100% of design capacity.The contents of the methods of  depreciation are prescribed in detail in Appendix 2 issued together with this Circular.3. The enterprises shall decide the method of depreciation, the time of deduction of the fixed assets as prescribed in the Circular and inform the directly managing tax agency prior to implementation.4. Method of depreciation applicable to each fixed asset which the enterprise has chosen and notified the directly managing tax must be implemented consistently during the process of utilization of fixed assets. In special case of changing method of depreciation, the enterprises must clearly explain the changes in the way of using the fixed assets to bring economic benefits to the enterprises. Each fixed asset is allowed to change only one method of depreciation during the utilization and must be notified in writing to the directly managing tax office.Chapter IV: IMPLEMENTATION ORGANIZATIONArticle 14.

Straight-line depreciation method:1. Content of the method:The fixed assets in the enterprises are depreciated by the straight-line depreciation method as follows:- Determining the annual average rate of depreciation for the fixed assets by the following formula:Annual average rate of depreciation for the fixed assets  = Primary price of fixed assets     Time of depreciation  - Monthly average rate of depreciation equal to the yearly depreciation divided by 12 months.2. In case the time of depreciation or the primary price of the fixed assets changes, the enterprise have to re-determine the average rate of depreciation of the fixed assets by taking the Residual value in the accounting book divided by the time of depreciation re-determined or remaining time of depreciation (determined as the difference between the time of depreciation registered minus the time of depreciation) of the fixed assets.3. The rate of depreciation for the final year of the time of depreciation of fixed assets is determined as the difference between the primary price of fixed assets and the accumulated depreciation made to the preceding year of the final year of those fixed assets.4.

Knowing that fixed assets have technical life service is 12 years, the time of depreciation of fixed assets is 10 years as expected (in accordance with the provisions of Appendix 1 issued together with the Circular No.. .../2013/TT- BTC), the fixed assets are put into use on January 01, 2013.Primary price of fixed assets = 119 million   5 million + 3 million = 120 million dongAnnual average rate of depreciation = 120 million : 10 years = 12 million/yearMonthly average rate of depreciation = 12 million dong : 12 months = 1 million dong/monthAnnually, the enterprises shall deduct 12 million dong of the cost of depreciation of fixed assets into the business costs.b. After 5 years of use, the enterprises shall upgrade their fixed assets with a total cost of 30 million dong, the utilization time re-evaluated is 6 years (increasing 1 year compared with the utilization time initially registered). The date completed and put into use is January 01, 2018.Primary price of fixed assets = 120 million dong + 30 million dong = 50 million dongDepreciation deducted = 12 million dong (x) 5 years = 60 million dongResidual value in accounting book = 150 million dong - 60 million dong = 90 million dong Annual average rate of depreciation =                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            9 0   t r i   u       n g   :   6   y e a r s   =   1 5   m i l l i o n   d o n g   /   y e a r  M o n t h l y   a v e r a g e   r a t e   o f   d e p r e c i a t i o n   = 1 5 . 0 0 0 . 0 0 0       n g   :   1 2   m o n t h s   = 1 . 2 5 0 . 0 0 0   d o n g /   m o n t h  F r o m   2 0 1 8   o n w a r d s ,   t h e   e n t e r p r i s e s   s h a l l   d e p r e c i a t e   1 . 2 5 0 . 0 0 0   d o n g   p e r   m o n t h   i n t o   t h e   b u s i n e s s   c o s t s   f o r   t h e   f i x e d   a s s ets upgraded.5. Determination of rate of depreciation for fixed assets put into use before October 01, 2013:a. Way to determine the rate of depreciation:- Based on the data in the accounting books and records of fixed assets to determine their Residual value in the accounting books of fixed assets.- Determining the remaining time of depreciation of fixed assets by the following formula:  EMBED Equation.3     In which:T : Remaining time of depreciation of fixed assets T1 : Time of depreciation of fixed assets is determined under provisions of Annex 1 issued together with the Circular No. 203/2009/TT-BTC.T2 : Time of depreciation of fixed assets is determined under provisions of Annex 1 issued together with the Circular No. ..../2013/TT-BTC.t1 : Actual time of depreciation of fixed assets - Determining the annual rate of depreciation (for the remaining years of fixed assets) as follows:Annual average rate of depreciation of fixed assets  = Residual value of fixed assets     Remaining time of depreciation of fixed assets   - The monthly average rate of depreciation equal to the yearly depreciation deduction divided by 12 months. b. Example of calculation and depreciation of fixed assets:Ex: An enterprise uses a mining machine with primary price of 600 million dong since January 01, 2011. The utilization time determined in accordance with Annex 1 issued together with the Circular No. 203/2009/TT-BTC is 10 years. The time for using this mining machine by the end of December 31, 2012 is 2 years. The accumulated depreciation is 120 million dong.- Residual value in accounting books of mining machine is 480 million dong.- The enterprise determines the time of depreciation of the mining machine is 15 years under the Annex I of the Circular No..... /2013/TT-BTC.- Determining the remaining time of depreciation of the mining machine is as follows:Remaining time of  = 15 years x ( 1 - 2 years ) = 12 years     10 years   - Annual average rate of depreciation = 480 million dong : 12 years = 40 million dong/year (under Circular No....... /2013/TT-BTC)Monthly average rate of depreciation = 480 million dong : 12 months = 3.333  million dong/monthFrom January 01, 2013 to the end of December 31, 2024, the enterprise shall carry out depreciation for the mining machine into the monthly business costs of 3.333  million dong.II. Adjusted reducing balance method:1. Content of the method:The rate of depreciation of fixed assets by this method is determined such as:- Determining the time of depreciation of fixed assets:The enterprises shall determine the time of depreciation of fixed assets as provided for in the Circular No..... /2013/TT-BTC of the Ministry of Finance.- Determining the annual rate of depreciation of fixed assets in the years by the following formula:Annual rate of depreciation of fixed assets = Residual value of fixed assets X Accelerated depreciation rate  In which:The accelerated depreciation rate is determined by the following formula:Accelerated depreciation rate (%) = Rate of depreciation by straight-line method X Adjustment coefficient  Rate of depreciation of fixed assets by the straight-line method is determined as follows:Rate of depreciation of fixed assets by the straight-line method (%) = 1 X 100    Time of depreciation of fixed assets    Adjsutment coefficient is determined by the time of depreciation of fixed assets specified in the following table:Time of depreciation of fixed assets Adjsutment coefficient(time)  Up to 4 years ( t ( 4 years) 1,5  Over 4 to 6 years (4 years <t ( 6 years) 2,0  Over 6 years (t> 6 years) 2,5  For the last years, when the annual rate of depreciation determined by the reducing balance method above mentioned is equal to ( or lower) the average rate of depreciation between the Residual value and remaining number of years of utilization of fixed assets, then from that year, the rate of depreciation is calculated by the Residual value of the fixed assets divided by the remaining number of years of utilization of fixed assets.- The monthly rate of depreciation is equal to the yearly deducted depreciation divided by 12 months.2. Example of calculation and depreciation of fixed assets:Ex: Company A has purchased a new device producing electronic components with the primary price of 50 million dong. The time of depreciation of fixed assets determined in accordance with Appendix 1 (issued together with Circular No..../ 2013/TT-BTC) is 5 years.Determining the annual rate of depreciation as follows:- Annual rate of depreciation of fixed assets by the straight-line method is 20%.- Accelerated depreciation rate by the reducing balance method is equal to 20% x 2 (adjustment coefficient) = 40%- Annual rate of depreciation of the above fixed assets is determined in the following table:Unit: DongYear Residual value of fixed assets  Way to calculate annual depreciation of fixed assets  Annual rate of depreciation Monthly rate of depreciation Year-end accumulated depreciation  1 50.000.000 50.000.000 x 40% 20.000.000 1.666.666 20.000.000  2 30.000.000 30.000.000 x 40% 12.000.000 1.000.000 32.000.000  3 18.000.000 18.000.000 x 40% 7.200.000 600.000 39.200.000  4 10.800.000 10.800.000 : 2 5.400.000 450.000 44.600.000  5 10.800.000 10.800.000 : 2 5.400.000 450.000 50.000.000  In which:+ Rate of depreciation of fixed assets from the 1st year to the 3rd year is calculated by the Residual value of fixed assets multiplied by the accelerated depreciation rate(40%).+ From the 4th year onwards, annual rate of depreciation is equal to the Residual value of fixed assets (in the beginning of the 4th year) divided by the remaining number of years of utilization of fixed assets (10.800.000 : 2 = 5.400.000). [Because in the 4th year: the rate of depreciation by reducing balance method (10.800.000 x 40%= 4.320.000) is lower the average rate of depreciation between the Residual value and remaining number of year of utilization of fixed assets (10.800.000 : 2 = 5.400.000)(.III. Method of depreciation based on volume:1. Content of the method:The fixed assets in enterprises are depreciated by this method as follows:- Based on the technical-economic records of the fixed assets, the enterprises shall determine the total amount and volume of products made according to the design capacity of fixed assets, referred to as the output by capacity design.- Based on the actual situation of production, the enterprise shall determine the actual amount and volume of products made monthly, annually of the fixed assets.- Determining the monthly rate of depreciation of                                                     ^   o   q                                             p]G2                          ( h,?P  h(<t CJ  OJ  QJ  ^J  aJ  mH  sH   + h,?P  hl   5  CJ  OJ  QJ  ^J  aJ  mH  sH  % h,?P 5  CJ  OJ  QJ  ^J  aJ  mH  sH  % h,?P 5  CJ  OJ  QJ  ^J  aJ  mH  sH  + h,?P  h,?P 6  CJ  OJ  QJ  ^J  aJ  mH  sH  ( h,?P  h,?P CJ  OJ  QJ  ^J  aJ  mH  sH   # h     h,?P 5  CJ  OJ  QJ  ^J  aJ    h     h,?P CJ  OJ  QJ  ^J  aJ   . h     h,?P 5  CJ  OJ  QJ  \  ^J  aJ  mH* sH*  + h,?P  h,?P 5  CJ  OJ  QJ  ^J  aJ  mH  sH            p   q                                                                                =                            V  kdf    $  $ If      0       "

Example of calculation and depreciation of fixed assets:For example: Company A purchased bulldozer (new 100%) with the primary price of 450 million dong. The design capacity of this bulldozer is 30m3/hour. The output by the design capacity of this machine is 2.400.000 m3. The product volume gained in the first year of this bulldozer is:Month Volume of product finished (m3) Month Volume of product finished (m3)  Month 1 14.000 Month 7 15.000  Month 2 15.000 Month 8 14.000  Month 3 18.000 Month 9 16.000  Month 4 16.000 Month 10 16.000  Month 5 15.000 Month 11 18.000  Month 6 14.000 Month 12 18.000  The rate of depreciation by the method of depreciation based on volume is determined as follows:- The average rate of depreciation for 1 m3 of bulldozed land= 450 million dong: 2.400.000 m3 = 187.5 dong/m3- Rate of depreciation of the bulldozer is calculated in the following table:Month Month Monthly actual output(m3) Month Monthly rate of depreciation(dong)  1 14.000 14.000 x 187.5 = 2.625.000  2 15.000 15.000 x 187.5 = 2.812.500  3 18.000 18.000 x 187.5 = 3.375.000  4 16.000 16.000 x 187.5 = 3.000.000  5 15.000 15.000 x 187.5 = 2.812.500  6 14.000 14.000 x 187.5 = 2.625.000  7 15.000 15.000 x 187.5 = 2.812.500  8 14.000 14.000 x 187.5 = 2.625.000  9 16.000 16.000 x 187.5 = 3.000.000  10 16.000 16.000 x 187.5 = 3.000.000  11 18.000 18.000 x 187.5 = 3.375.000  12 18.000 18.000 x 187.5 = 3.375.000   Total of year 35.437.500       PAGE    PAGE   7
