22
Allens -Vietnam LawsOnline Database on www.vietnamlaws.com
+ Deduction for family circumstance for 2 dependants (2 children):
3.6 million dong × 2 = 7.2 million dong
+ Social insurance and health insurance:
40 million dong × (7% + 1,5%) = 3.4 million dong
Total deductions are:
9 million dong+ 7.2 million dong+ 3.4 million dong= 19.6 million dong
- The assessable income of Ms C is:
40 million dong –19.6 million dong = 20.4 million dong
- Amount of tax payable:
Method 1: The amount of tax payable is assessed in accordance with each bracket of the
scale of progressive tax tariff:
+ Bracket 1: the portion of assessable income up to five million dong and
tax rate 5%:
5 million dong × 5% = 0.25 million dong

million dong and tax rate 15%:
(18 million dong -10 million dong) × 15% = 1.2 million dong
+ Bracket 4: the portion of assessable income over 18 million dong to 32
million dong and tax rate 20%:
(20.4 million dong -18 million dong) × 20% = 0.48 million dong

must be converted into assessable income in accordance with Appendix No. 02-PL-TNCN issued
with this Circular in order to determine the taxable income.In particular:
(a) The income which serves as the basis for conversion into assessable income is the income
actually received plus (+) the benefits paid by the employer on behalf of the employee (if any)
less (-) the deductions. In the case where the benefits paid on behalf [of the employee] include
house rent, the amount of house rent actually paid is included in the income which serves as
the basis for conversion but does not exceed 15% of the total taxable income in the unit (not
including the house rent).
The formula to determine the income which serves as the basis for conversion:
Amounts paid
Income
Income which serves as on behalf [of

24
Allens -Vietnam LawsOnline Database on www.vietnamlaws.com
31.5 million dong + 1 million dong – (9 million dong + 1.5 million dong) =
22 million dong
- The assessable income (determined according to Appendix No. 02-PL-
TNCN) is:
(22 million dong –1.65 million dong)/0.8 = 25.4375 million dong
- The amount of personal income tax payable by Mr D is (applying the
abbreviated method for tax assessment in Appendix No. 01-PL-TNCN) is:
25.4375 million dong × 20% -1.65 million dong = 3.4375 million dong
Example 6: Supposing Mr D in the above example 5 also has his house rent of 6 million
dong per month paid by Company X on his behalf. The monthly personal
income tax payable by Mr D is as follows:
Step 1: Determining the house rent paid on his behalf to be included in the
income which serves as the basis for conversion
- Income which serves as the basis for conversion (not including the house
rent):
31.5 million dong + 1 million dong – (9 million dong + 1.5 million dong) =
22 million dong
- The assessable income (determined according to Appendix No. 02-PL-
TNCN) is:
(22 million dong –1.65 million dong)/0.8 = 25.4375 million dong
- Taxable income (not including the house rent):
25.4375 million dong + 9 million dong + 1.5 million dong = 35.9375 million
dong/month
- 15% of the total taxable income (not including the house rent):
35.9375 million dong × 15% = 5.390 million dong/month
Thus, the house rent included in the income which serves as the basis for
conversion is 5.390 million dong/month
Step 2: Determination of assessable income
- Income which serves as the basis for conversion into assessable income:
31.5 million dong + 1 million dong + 5.390 million dong –(9 million dong +
1.5 million dong) = 27.39million dong/month
- The assessable income (converted according to Appendix No. 02-PL-
TNCN) is:
25
Allens -Vietnam LawsOnline Database on www.vietnamlaws.com
(27.39 million dong –3.25 million dong)/0.75 = 32.187 million dong/month
- Personal income tax payable:
32.187 million dong × 25% -3.25 million dong = 4.797 million dong/month
- The monthly taxable income of Mr D is:
31.5 million dong + 1 million dong + 5.390 million dong + 4.797 million
dong = 42.687 million dong/month
Or determined in another way:
32.187 million dong + 9 million dong + 1.5 million dong = 42.687 million
dong/month.
(b) In the case where an individual is subject to tax finalization according to regulations, the
taxable income of the year is the total of monthly taxable income determined on the basis of
the converted assessable income. Where an individual has income not including tax from
many income-paying organizations, the taxable income of the year is the total of the monthly
taxable incomes from the income-paying organizations in the year.
Example 7: Assuming that Mr D in example 6 above, in addition to the income from
Company X, from January 2014 to May 2014, also has a contract under which
he receives the income of 12 million dong/month from Company Y. Company
Y also pays personal income tax on Mr D's behalf.
The personal income tax finalization of Mr D in 2014 is as follows:
- The annual taxable income of Mr D at Company X is:
42.687 million dong x 12 months= 512.244 million dong
- At Company Y:
+ Monthly assessable income (converted according to Appendix No.
02-PL-TNCN):
(12 million dong –0.75 million dong)/0.85 = 13.235 million dong
+ Annual taxableincome at Company Y:
13.235 million dong x 5 months= 66.175 million dong
- Total taxable income of Mr D in 2014:
512.244 million dong + 66.175 million dong = 578.419 million dong
- Monthly assessable income:
26
Allens -Vietnam LawsOnline Database on www.vietnamlaws.com
(578.419 million dong : 12 months) - (9 million dong + 1.5 million dong) =
37.702 million dong
- Personal income tax payable for the year:
(37.702 million dong × 25% - 3.25 million dong) × 12 months = 74.105
million dong.

deduction ismade once from the aggregate total of both types of income.
(b) Level of deductions for family circumstances
(b.1) The level of deduction applicable to a taxpayer is 9 million dong/month, 108 million
dong/year.
(b.2) The level of deduction for each dependant is 3,6 million dong/month.
(c) Principles for assessing deductions for family circumstances

work from 1 March 2014. Mr E's labour contract ends and
he leaves for his country on 15 November 2014. From 1
March 2014 to his departure for his country, Mr E is

labour contract and leaves Vietnam. During the period
from 21 September 2013 to 15 June 2014, Ms G is
present in Vietnam for 187 days. Thus, in the first tax
assessment year (from 21 September 2013 to 20
September 2014), Ms G is considered as a resident
individual of Vietnam and is entitled to deductions for
family circumstances for herself from September 2013 to
the end of June 2014.

Allens -Vietnam LawsOnline Database on www.vietnamlaws.com
134 million dong + 106 million dong = 240 million dong
- Deductions for family circumstances:9 million dong x 12
= 108 million dong
- Assessable income:240 million dong –108 million dong
= 132 million dong
- Personal income tax payable in the first tax assessment
year: 60 million dong x 5% + (120 million dong - 60
million dong) x 10% + (132 million dong - 120 million
dong) × 15% = 10,8 million dong
+ Second tax assessment year (from 1 January 2015 to the
end of 31 December 2015): Mr S is in Vietnam for 215 days
(110 days + 105 days) and is a resident individual in
Vietnam.
- Taxable income arising in 2015:
106 million dong + 122 million dong = 228 million dong
- Deductions for family circumstances:9 million dong x 12
= 108 million dong
- Assessable income in 2015:
228 million dong –108 million dong = 120 million dong
- Personal income tax payable in 2015:
(60 million dong x 5%) + (120 million dong – 60 million
dong) x 10% = 9 million dong
+ The tax finalization in 2015 has 5 months which overlap with
the tax finalization in the first year (from January 2015 to May
