AND
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
FOR
THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION
AND
THE PREVENTION OF FISCAL EVASION
WITH RESPECT TO TAXES
ON INCOME
The Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Government
of the United States of America,
Desiring to conclude an Agreement for the avoidance of double taxation and
the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income,
Have agreed as follows:
ARTICLE 1
PERSONS COVERED AND GENERAL SCOPE
1. This Agreement shall apply only to persons who are residents of one or
both of the Contracting States, except as otherwise provided in the
Agreement.

3. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (b) of paragraph 2
of this Article:
(i) for purposes of paragraph 3 of Article XXII (Consultation) of
the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the Contracting
States agree that any question arising as to the interpretation
or application of this Agreement and, in particular, whether a
taxation measure is within the scope of this Agreement, shall
be determined exclusively in accordance with the provisions
of Article 26 (Mutual Agreement Procedure) of this
Agreement; and
(ii) the provisions of Article XVII of the General Agreement on
Trade in Services shall not apply to a taxation measure unless
the competent authorities agree that the measure is not within

Agreement.
2
(b) For the purposes of this paragraph, a “measure” is a law,
regulation, rule, procedure, decision, administrative action, or any
similar provision or action.
4. Except to the extent provided in paragraph 5, this Agreement shall not
affect the taxation by a Contracting State of its residents (as determined
under Article 4 (Resident)) and its citizens. Notwithstanding the other
provisions of this Agreement, a former citizen or former long-term
resident of a Contracting State may, for the period of ten years following
the loss of such status, be taxed in accordance with the laws of that
Contracting State.
5. The provisions of paragraph 4 shall not affect:
(a) the benefits conferred by a Contracting State under paragraph 2 of
Article 9 (Associated Enterprises), paragraphs 1(b), 2, and 5 of
Article 18 (Pensions, Social Security, Annuities, Alimony, and
Child Support), paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 19 (Pension Funds),
and Articles 24 (Methods for Elimination of Double Taxation), 25
(Non-Discrimination), and 26 (Mutual Agreement Procedure); and
(b) the benefits conferred by a Contracting State under Articles 20
(Government Service), 21 (Students and Apprentices), and 28
(Members of Diplomatic Missions and Consular Posts), upon
individuals who are neither citizens of, nor have been admitted for
permanent residence in that State.
6. An item of income, profit or gain derived through an entity that is
fiscally transparent under the laws of either Contracting State shall be
considered to be derived by a resident of a Contracting State to the
extent that the item is treated for purposes of the taxation law of such
Contracting State as the income, profit or gain of a resident.
ARTICLE 2
TAXES COVERED
1. This Agreement shall apply to taxes on income imposed on behalf of a
Contracting State irrespective of the manner in which they are levied.
3
2. There shall be regarded as taxes on income all taxes imposed on total
income, or on elements of income, including taxes on gains from the
alienation of property.
3. The existing taxes to which this Agreement shall apply are:
(a) in the case of Viet Nam:
(i) the personal income tax; and
(ii) the business income tax;
(b) in the case of the United States: the Federal income taxes imposed
by the Internal Revenue Code (but excluding social security and
unemployment taxes), and the Federal taxes imposed on the
investment income of foreign private foundations.
4. This Agreement shall also apply to any identical or substantially similar
taxes that are imposed after the date of signature of the Agreement in
addition to, or in place of, the existing taxes. The competent authorities
of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any changes that
have been made in their respective taxation or other laws that
significantly affect their obligations under this Agreement.

place of incorporation, place of registration, place of management, or

thereof, but not under the laws of the other Contracting State or a
political subdivision thereof, such company shall be deemed to be a
resident only of the first-mentioned Contracting State. In all other cases
7
involving a dual resident company, the company shall not be treated as a
resident of either Contracting State for purposes of its claiming any
benefits provided by the Agreement.
5. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article a
person other than an individual or a company is a resident of both
Contracting States, the competent authorities of the Contracting States
shall by mutual agreement endeavor to determine the mode of
application of this Agreement to that person.
ARTICLE 5
PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT
1. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “permanent establishment”
means a fixed place of business through which the business of an
enterprise is wholly or partly carried on.
2. The term “permanent establishment” includes especially:
(a) a place of management;
(b) a branch;
(c) an office;
(d) a factory;
(e) a workshop; and
(f) a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction
of natural resources.
3. The term “permanent establishment” likewise encompasses:
(a) a building site, construction, exploration, assembly or installation
project or supervisory activities in connection therewith, but only if
such site, project or activities last more than six months; and
(b) the furnishing of services, including consultancy services, in a
Contracting State by an enterprise of the other Contracting State
through employees or other personnel engaged by the enterprise for
8
such purpose, but only if activities of that nature continue (for the
same or a connected project) within the first-mentioned Contracting
State for a period or periods aggregating more than six months
within any twelve-month period.
4. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term
“permanent establishment” shall be deemed not to include:
(a) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or
delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise;
(b) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to
the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery;
(c) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to
the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another
enterprise;
(d) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose
of purchasing goods or merchandise, or of collecting information
for the enterprise;
(e) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose
of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory
or auxiliary character; and
(f) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any
combination of the activities mentioned in subparagraphs (a)
through (e), provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of
business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or
auxiliary character.
5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person
other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 6
applies is acting in a Contracting State on behalf of an enterprise of the
other Contracting State, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a
permanent establishment in the first-mentioned Contracting State in
respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise,
if such a person has and habitually exercises in that Contracting State an
authority to conclude contracts in the name of the enterprise, unless the
activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 4
that, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this
9
fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions
of that paragraph.
6. An enterprise of a Contracting State shall not be deemed to have a
permanent establishment in the other Contracting State merely because
it carries on business in that other Contracting State through a broker,
general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status,
provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their
business as independent agents. However, when the activities of such an
agent are devoted wholly or almost wholly on behalf of that enterprise,
and conditions are made or imposed between that enterprise and the
agent in their commercial and financial relations which differ from those
which would have been made between independent enterprises, he shall
not be considered an agent of an independent status within the meaning
of this paragraph.
7. The fact that a company that is a resident of a Contracting State controls
or is controlled by a company that is a resident of the other Contracting
State, or that carries on business in that other Contracting State (whether
through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself
constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.
ARTICLE 6
INCOME FROM IMMOVABLE PROPERTY (REAL PROPERTY)
1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable
property (real property) (including income from agriculture or forestry)
situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other
Contracting State.
2. The term “immovable property (real property)” shall have the meaning
which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property
in question is situated. The term shall in any case include property
accessory to immovable property (real property), (including livestock
and equipment used in agriculture and forestry), rights to which the
provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, usufruct of
immovable property (real property) and rights to variable or fixed
payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work,
mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources; ships and aircraft
shall not be regarded as immovable property (real property).
10
3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the
direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property (real
property).
4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income
from immovable property (real property) of an enterprise and to income
from immovable property (real property) used for the performance of
independent personal services.
ARTICLE 7
BUSINESS PROFITS
1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only
in that Contracting State unless the enterprise carries on business in the
other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated
therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of
the enterprise may be taxed in the other Contracting State but only so
much of them as are attributable to that permanent establishment.
2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a
Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State
through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each
Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the
profits that it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate
enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or
similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise
of which it is a permanent establishment.
3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be
allowed as deductions expenses that are incurred for the purposes of the
business of the permanent establishment, including executive and
general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the Contracting
State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.
4. Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the
profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an
apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts,
nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude such Contracting State from
determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be
customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be
11
such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained
in this Article.
5. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed
to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method
year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.
6. Where profits include items of income that are dealt with separately in
other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles
shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.
7. In applying this Article, paragraph 5 of Article 10 (Dividends),
paragraph 6 of Article 11 (Interest), paragraph 4 of Article 12
(Royalties), paragraph 3 of Article 13 (Gains from the Alienation of
Property) and paragraph 2 of Article 22 (Other Income), any income or
gain attributable to a permanent establishment during its existence is
taxable in the Contracting State where such permanent establishment is
situated even if the payments are deferred until such permanent
establishment has ceased to exist.
ARTICLE 8
SHIPPING AND AIR TRANSPORT
1. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of
ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State.
2. For purposes of this Article, profits from the operation of ships or
aircraft in international traffic include:
(a) profits from the rental of ships or aircraft on a full (time or voyage)
basis in international traffic;
(b) profits from the rental on a bareboat basis of ships or aircraft in
international traffic if the rental income is incidental to profits from
the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic.
3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to profits from the
participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating
agency.
12
ARTICLE 9
ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES
1. Where
(a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or
indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of
the other Contracting State, or
(b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the
management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting
State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,
and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two
enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from
those that would be made between independent enterprises, then any
profits that, but for those conditions, would have accrued to one of the
enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions have not so accrued, may
be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.
2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that
State, and taxes accordingly, profits on which an enterprise of the other
Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other Contracting
State, and the other Contracting State agrees that the profits so included
are profits that would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-
mentioned Contracting State if the conditions made between the two
enterprises had been those that would have been made between
independent enterprises, then that other Contracting State shall make an
appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those
profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the
other provisions of this Agreement and the competent authorities of the
Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.
ARTICLE 10
DIVIDENDS
1. Dividends paid by a company that is a resident of a Contracting State to
a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other
Contracting State.
13
2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of
which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to
the laws of that Contracting State, but if the beneficial owner of the
dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State, except as
otherwise provided, the tax so charged shall not exceed:
(a) 5 percent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial
owner is a company that owns:
(i) directly at least 25 percent of the voting stock of the company
paying the dividends, if such company is a resident of the
United States; or
(ii) directly at least 25 percent of the capital of the company
paying the dividends, if such company is a resident of Viet
Nam;
(b) 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.
This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of
the profits out of which the dividends are paid.
3. (a) Subparagraph (a) of paragraph 2 shall not apply in the case of
dividends paid by a U.S. Regulated Investment Company (RIC) or
a U.S. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) or a Vietnamese Real
Estate Investment Fund (VREIF). In the case of dividends paid by a
RIC, subparagraph (b) of paragraph 2 shall apply. In the case of
dividends paid by a REIT or a VREIF, subparagraph (b) of
paragraph 2 shall apply only if:
(i) the beneficial owner of the dividends is an individual or
pension fund, in either case holding an interest of not more
than 10 percent in the REIT or the VREIF;
(ii) the dividends are paid with respect to a class of stock that is
publicly traded and the beneficial owner of the dividends is a
person holding an interest of not more than 5 percent of any
class of the REIT’s stock or the VREIF’s stock; or
(iii) the beneficial owner of the dividends is a person holding an
interest of not more than 10 percent in the REIT or the VREIF
and the REIT or the VREIF is diversified.
14
(b) For purposes of this paragraph, a REIT or a VREIF shall be
“diversified” if the value of no single interest in immovable
property (real property) exceeds 10 percent of its total interests in
immovable property (real property). For the purposes of this rule,
foreclosure property shall not be considered an interest in
immovable property (real property). Where a REIT holds an
interest in a partnership, it shall be treated as owning directly a
proportion of the partnership's interests in immovable property
(real property) corresponding to its interest in the partnership.
4. The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares,
mining shares, founders’ shares or other rights, not being debt-claims,
participating in profits, as well as other income that is subjected to the
same taxation treatment as income from shares under the laws of the
State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.
5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 through 3 shall not apply if the
beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting
State, carries on business in the other Contracting State, of which the
company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent
establishment situated therein, or performs in that other Contracting
State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein,
and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively
connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case
the provisions of Article 7 (Business Profits) or Article 14 (Independent
Personal Services), as the case may be, shall apply.
6. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives
profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other
Contracting State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the
company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that
other Contracting State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the
dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent
establishment or a fixed base situated in that other Contracting State, nor
subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on the company’s
undistributed profits, except as provided in paragraph 7, even if the
dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of
profits or income arising in such other Contracting State.
7. (a) A company that is a resident of one of the Contracting States and
that has a permanent establishment in the other State or that is
subject to tax in the other Contracting State on a net basis on its
15
income that may be taxed in the other Contracting State under
Article 6 (Income from Immovable Property (Real Property)) or
under paragraph 1 of Article 13 (Gains from the Alienation of
Property) may be subject in that other Contracting State to a tax in
addition to the tax allowable under the other provisions of this
Agreement.
(b) Such tax, however, may be imposed:
(i) on only the portion of the business profits of the company
attributable to the permanent establishment and the portion of
the income referred to in subparagraph (a) that is subject to tax
under Article 6 (Income from Immovable Property (Real
Property)) or under paragraph 1 of Article 13 (Gains from the
Alienation of Property) that, in the case of the United States,
represents the dividend equivalent amount of such profits or
income and, in the case of Viet Nam, is an amount that is
analogous to the dividend equivalent amount; and
(ii) at a rate not in excess of the rate specified in paragraph 2(a).
ARTICLE 11
INTEREST
1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other
Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State.
2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in
which it arises and according to the laws of that Contracting State, but if
the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting
State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 percent of the gross amount
of the interest.
3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, interest described in
paragraph 1 shall be taxable only in the Contracting State in which the
recipient is a resident if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident
of that Contracting State, and the interest is paid by the Contracting
State in which the interest arises or by the central bank, a political
subdivision or a local authority thereof.
4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2:
16
(a) interest arising in a Contracting State that is determined with
reference to receipts, sales, income, profits or other cash flow of the
debtor or a related person, to any change in the value of any
property of the debtor or a related person or to any dividend,
partnership distribution or similar payment made by the debtor or a
related person may be taxed in the Contracting State in which it
arises, and according to the laws of that Contracting State, but if the
beneficial owner is a resident of the other Contracting State, the
interest may be taxed at a rate not exceeding 15 percent of the gross
amount of the interest; and
(b) interest that is an excess inclusion with respect to a residual interest
in a real estate mortgage investment conduit may be taxed by each
Contracting State in accordance with its domestic law.
5. The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-
claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage, and whether
or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits, and in
particular, income from government securities and income from bonds
or debentures, including premiums or prizes attaching to such securities,
bonds or debentures, and all other income that is subjected to the same
taxation treatment as income from money lent by the taxation law of the
Contracting State in which the income arises. Income dealt with in
Article 10 (Dividends) and penalty charges for late payment shall not be
regarded as interest for the purposes of this Article.
6. The provisions of paragraphs 1 through 4 shall not apply if the
beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State,
carries on business in the other Contracting State, in which the interest
arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs
in that other Contracting State independent personal services from a
fixed base situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the
interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent
establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7
(Business Profits) or Article 14 (Independent Personal Services), as the
case may be, shall apply.
7. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is
that State itself, a political subdivision or entity thereof, a local authority
or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the
interest, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a
Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in
17
connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid
was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent
establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise
in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment or fixed
base is situated.
8. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the
beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the
amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is
paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the
payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the
provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount.
In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable
according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to
the other provisions of this Agreement.
9. The excess, if any, of the amount of interest allocable to the profits of a
company resident in a Contracting State that are:
(a) attributable to a permanent establishment in the other Contracting
State (including gains under paragraph 3 of Article 13 (Gains from
the Alienation of Property)); or
(b) subject to tax in the other Contracting State under Article 6
(Income from Immovable Property (Real Property)) or paragraph 1
of Article 13 (Gains from the Alienation of Property),
over the interest paid by that permanent establishment, or in the case of
profits subject to tax under Article 6 (Income from Immovable Property
(Real Property)) or paragraph 1 of Article 13 (Gains from the Alienation
of Property), over the interest paid by that company shall be deemed to
arise in that other Contracting State and be beneficially owned by a
resident of the first-mentioned Contracting State. The tax imposed under
this Article on such interest shall not exceed the rate provided in
paragraph 2.
ARTICLE 12
ROYALTIES
1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the
other Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State.
18
2. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in
which they arise and according to the laws of that Contracting State, but
if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other
Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed:
(a) 5 percent of the gross amount of the royalties described in
subparagraph (a) of paragraph 3;
(b) 10 percent of the gross amount of the royalties described in
subparagraph (b) of paragraph 3.
3. The term “royalties” as used in this Article means:
(a) payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or
the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the term “royalties” shall
not include the following payments to which the provisions of
Article 7 (Business Profits) shall apply:
(i) payments for the rental on a bareboat basis of ships or aircraft
if such ships or aircraft are operated in international traffic by
the lessee; or
(ii) payments for the use, maintenance or rental of containers
(including trailers, barges, and related equipment for the
transport of containers), except to the extent that those
containers are used for transport solely between places within
the other Contracting State;
(b) payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or

work (including cinematographic films, films or tapes used for
radio or television broadcasting), any patent, trademark, design or
model, plan, secret formula or process.
4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial
owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on
business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise,
through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that
other Contracting State independent personal services from a fixed base
situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the
royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent
19
establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7
(Business Profits) or Article 14 (Independent Personal Services), as the
case may be, shall apply.
5. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer
is that Contracting State itself, a political subdivision or entity thereof, a
local authority or a resident of that Contracting State. Where, however,
the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting
State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or
fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was
incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment
or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the
Contracting State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is
situated.
6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the
beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the
amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information
for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been
agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of
such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the
last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments
shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due
regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement.

of residence, is paid or accrued, directly or indirectly, to
29
persons who are not residents of either Contracting State
entitled to the benefits of this Agreement under subparagraph
(a), subparagraph (b), clause (i) of subparagraph (c), or

that are deductible for purposes of the taxes covered by this
Agreement in the person’s Contracting State of residence (but

business for services or tangible property).
3. (a) A resident of a Contracting State shall be entitled to benefits of the
Agreement with respect to an item of income derived from the
other Contracting State, regardless of whether the resident is a
qualified person, if the resident is engaged in the active conduct of

person or persons.
4. If a resident of a Contracting State is neither a qualified person pursuant
to paragraph 2 nor entitled to benefits with respect to an item of income
under paragraph 3 of this Article, the competent authority of the other
Contracting State may, nevertheless, grant the benefits of this
Agreement, or benefits with respect to a specific item of income, if such

in the aggregate represent a majority of the aggregate voting power
and value of the company;
(c) the term “disproportionate class of shares” means any class of
shares of a company resident in one of the Contracting States that

assets or activities of the company; and
(d) a company's “primary place of management and control” shall be in
the Contracting State of which it is a resident only if executive

policy decision making for the company (including its direct and
indirect subsidiaries) in that Contracting State than in any other
state and the staff of such persons conduct more of the day-to-day
activities necessary for preparing and making those decisions in
that Contracting State than in any other state.
6. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, where an
enterprise of a Contracting State derives income from the other
Contracting State, and that income is attributable to a permanent
establishment which that enterprise has in a third jurisdiction, the tax
benefits that would otherwise apply under the other provisions of the
Agreement shall not apply to that income if the profits of that permanent
establishment are subject to a combined aggregate effective rate of tax in
the first-mentioned Contracting State and third state that is less than 60
percent of the general rate of company tax applicable in the first-
mentioned Contracting State. Any dividends, interest or royalties to
which the provisions of this paragraph apply shall be subject to tax in
the other Contracting State at a rate that shall not exceed 15 percent of
the gross amount thereof. Any other income to which the provisions of
this paragraph apply shall be subject to tax under the provisions of the

provision of the Agreement. The provisions of this paragraph shall not
apply if:
(a) in the case of royalties, the royalties are received as compensation
for the use of, or the right to use, intangible property produced or
developed by the permanent establishment itself; or
(b) in the case of any other income, the income derived from the other
Contracting State is derived in connection with, or is incidental to,
the active conduct of a trade or business carried on by the
permanent establishment in the third jurisdiction (other than the
business of making, managing or simply holding investments for
32
the enterprise’s own account, unless these activities are banking or
securities activities carried on by a bank or registered securities
dealer).
ARTICLE 24
METHODS FOR ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION
1. In the case of Viet Nam, double taxation shall be eliminated as follows:
(a) Where a resident of Viet Nam derives income, profits or gains
which under the law of the United States and in accordance with
this Agreement may be taxed in the United States, Viet Nam shall
allow as a credit against its tax on the income, profits or gains an
amount equal to the tax paid to the United States. The amount of
credit, however, shall not exceed the amount of the Vietnamese tax
on that income, profits or gains computed in accordance with the
taxation laws and regulations of Viet Nam.
(b) In the case of a Vietnamese company owning at least 10 percent of
the voting stock of a company that is a resident of the United States
and from which the Vietnamese company receives dividends, Viet
Nam shall allow as a credit against its tax on the income an amount
equal to the tax paid to the United States by or on behalf of the
payer with respect to the profits out of which the dividends are
paid.
(c) Where a resident of Viet Nam derives income, profits or gains that,
in accordance with any provision of the Agreement, is taxable only
in the United States, Viet Nam may nevertheless, in calculating the
amount of tax on the remaining income, profits or gains of such
resident in Viet Nam, take into account the exempted income.
2. In accordance with the provisions and subject to the limitations of the
law of the United States (as it may be amended from time to time
without changing the general principle hereof), the United States shall
allow to a resident or citizen of the United States as a credit against the
United States tax on income applicable to residents and citizens:
(a) the income tax paid or accrued to Viet Nam by or on behalf of such
resident or citizen; and
33
(b) in the case of a United States company owning at least 10 percent
of the voting stock of a company that is a resident of Viet Nam and
from which the United States company receives dividends, the
income tax paid or accrued to Viet Nam by or on behalf of the
payer with respect to the profits out of which the dividends are
paid.
For the purposes of this paragraph, the taxes referred to in paragraphs
3(a) and 4 of Article 2 (Taxes Covered) shall be considered income
taxes.
3. For the purposes of applying paragraph 2 of this Article, an item of
gross income, as determined under the laws of the United States, derived
by a resident of the United States that, under this Agreement, may be
taxed in Viet Nam shall be deemed to be income from sources in Viet
Nam.
4. Where a United States citizen is a resident of Viet Nam:
(a) with respect to items of income that under the provisions of this
Agreement are exempt from United States tax or that are subject to
a reduced rate of United States tax when derived by a resident of
Viet Nam who is not a United States citizen, Viet Nam shall allow
as a credit against Vietnamese tax, only the tax paid, if any, that the
United States may impose under the provisions of this Agreement,
other than taxes that may be imposed solely by reason of
citizenship under the saving clause of paragraph 4 of Article 1
(Persons Covered and General Scope);
(b) for purposes of applying paragraph 2 to compute United States tax
on those items of income referred to in subparagraph (a), the
United States shall allow as a credit against United States tax the
income tax paid to Viet Nam after the credit referred to in
subparagraph (a); the credit so allowed shall not reduce the portion
of the United States tax that is creditable against the Vietnamese
tax in accordance with subparagraph (a); and
(c) for the exclusive purpose of relieving double taxation in the United
States under subparagraph (b), items of income referred to in
subparagraph (a) shall be deemed to arise in Viet Nam to the extent
necessary to avoid double taxation of such income under
subparagraph (b).

ARTICLE 25
NON-DISCRIMINATION
1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other
Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected
therewith that is other or more burdensome than the taxation and
connected requirements to which nationals of that other Contracting
State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected. This provision
shall also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the
Contracting States.
2. The taxation on a permanent establishment that an enterprise of a
Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less

activities.
3. Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9 (Associated
Enterprises), paragraph 8 of Article 11 (Interest), or paragraph 6 of
Article 12 (Royalties) apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements
paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other
Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable
profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if
they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned Contracting State.
Similarly, any debts of a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of
the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the
taxable capital of the first-mentioned resident, be deductible under the
same conditions as if they had been contracted to a resident of the
first-mentioned Contracting State.
4. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or
partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly by one or more
residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the
first-mentioned Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement
connected therewith that is other or more burdensome than the taxation
and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the
first-mentioned Contracting State are or may be subjected.
5. Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed as obliging either
Contracting State to grant to individuals not resident in that Contracting
State any of the personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for tax
35
purposes due to civil obligations or family duties granted by that
Contracting State to its residents.
6. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as preventing either
Contracting State from imposing a tax as described in paragraph 7 of
Article 10 (Dividends) and paragraph 9 of Article 11 (Interest).
7. The provisions of this Article shall, notwithstanding the provisions of
Article 2 (Taxes Covered), apply to taxes of every kind and description
imposed by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or local
authority thereof.

presenting claims for refunds, present its case to the competent authority
of the Contracting State of which that person is a resident or, if his case
comes under paragraph 1 of Article 25 (Non-Discrimination), to the
competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a national.
The case must be presented within three years from the first notification
of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions
of the Agreement.
2. The competent authority shall endeavor, if the objection appears to it to
be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution,
to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of
the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation
which is not in accordance with this Agreement. Any agreement reached
shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits or other
procedural limitations in the domestic law of the Contracting States.
3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavor to
resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the
interpretation or application of the Agreement. They may also consult
together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for
in the Agreement.
36
4. The competent authorities also may agree to adjust any specific
monetary threshold as referred to in the Agreement to reflect economic
or monetary developments.
5. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate
with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the
sense of the preceding paragraphs.
ARTICLE 27
EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE
ASSISTANCE
1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such
information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of
this Agreement or of the domestic laws of the Contracting States
concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed by the
Contracting States insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to
the Agreement, including information relating to the assessment or
collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the
determination of appeals in relation to, such taxes. The exchange of
information is not restricted by paragraph 1 of Article 1 (Persons
Covered and General Scope) or Article 2 (Taxes Covered).
2. Any information received under this Article by a Contracting State shall
be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under
the domestic laws of that Contracting State and shall be disclosed only
to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies)
involved in the assessment or collection, or administration of, the
enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in
relation to the taxes referred to above, or the oversight of such functions.
Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such
purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings
or in judicial decisions.
3. In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as
to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:
(a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and
administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;
37
(b) to supply information that is not obtainable under the laws or in the
normal course of the administration of that or of the other
Contracting State;
(c) to supply information that would disclose any trade, business,
industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or
information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public
policy.
4. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this
Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering
measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other
Contracting State may not need such information for its own tax
purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to
the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be
construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information
solely because it has no domestic interest in such information.
5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a
Contracting State to decline to supply information requested by the other
Contracting State because the information is held by a bank, other
financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a
fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interest in a person.
6. If specifically requested by the competent authority of a Contracting
State, the competent authority of the other Contracting State shall
provide information under this Article in the form of depositions and
authenticated copies of unedited original documents (including books,
papers, statements, records, accounts, and writings), to the extent such
depositions and documents can be obtained under the laws and
administrative practice of such other Contracting State with respect to
its own taxes.
7. Each of the Contracting States shall endeavor to collect on behalf of the
other Contracting State such amounts as may be necessary to ensure that
relief granted by the Agreement from taxation imposed by that other
Contracting State does not inure to the benefit of persons not entitled
thereto. This paragraph shall not impose upon either of the Contracting
States the obligation to carry out administrative measures that would be
contrary to its sovereignty, security, or public policy.

PROTOCOL TO THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIET NAM
AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION
AND THE PREVENTION OF FISCAL EVASION
WITH RESPECT TO TAXES ON INCOME
On signing the Agreement between the Government of the Socialist
Republic of Viet Nam and the Government of the United States of America
for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion
with respect to Taxes on Income (hereinafter referred to as “the Agreement”),
the two Contracting States have agreed to the following provisions:
1. With reference to paragraph 3(b) of Article 2 (Taxes Covered) of the
Agreement, it is understood that the Federal tax imposed on the
investment income of foreign private foundations shall not be imposed
on dividends, interest or royalties derived by private foundations
organized in Viet Nam at a rate in excess of the rates provided for in
Articles 10 (Dividends), 11 (Interest), and 12 (Royalties) of the
Agreement, respectively. It is also understood that such tax may be
imposed on other income derived by private foundations organized in
Viet Nam under Article 22 (Other Income).
2. With reference to subparagraph (j) of paragraph 1 of Article 3 (General
Definitions) of the Agreement, the term “pension fund” includes the
following:
(a) in the case of the United States, a trust providing pension or
retirement benefits under an Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)
qualified pension plan (which includes a Code section 401(k) plan
and a profit sharing or stock bonus plan); a Code section 403(a)
qualified annuity plan; a Code section 403(b) plan; a trust that is an
individual retirement account under Code section 408; a Roth
individual retirement account under Code section 408A; a simple
retirement account under Code section 408(p); a trust providing
pension or retirement benefits under a simplified employee pension
plan under Code section 408(k); a trust described in Code section
457(g) providing pension or retirement benefits under a Code
section 457(b) plan; and the Thrift Savings Fund (Code section
7701(j)). A group trust described in Revenue Ruling 81-100, as
amended by Revenue Ruling 2004-67, Revenue Ruling 2011-1, and
Revenue Ruling 2014-24, qualifies as a pension fund only if
42
substantially all of its activity is to earn income for the benefit of
pension funds that are themselves entitled to benefits under the
Agreement as a resident of the United States; and
(b) in the case of Viet Nam, the Social Security Funds established
under the Law No. 71/2006/QH11 dated June 29th 2006 on Social
Security; and
(c) any plan, fund or arrangement modified by or created pursuant to
legislation enacted by a Contracting State after the date of signature
of the Agreement that the competent authorities agree satisfies the
definition of “pension fund” in subparagraph (j) of paragraph 1 of
Article 3 (General Definitions) of the Agreement.
3. With reference to paragraph 2 of Article 7 (Business Profits) of the
Agreement, when an enterprise resident in Viet Nam carries on business
in the United States through a permanent establishment situated therein,
Section 864(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code shall not apply to treat
as profits attributable to the permanent establishment all income, gain,
or loss from sources within the United States other than income, gain, or
loss to which Section 864(c)(2) applies.
4. With reference to Article 10 (Dividends) of the Agreement,
notwithstanding paragraph 2 of Article 10, dividends shall not be taxed
in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a
resident if:
(a) the beneficial owner of the dividends is a pension fund that is a
resident of the other Contracting State; and
(b) such dividends are not derived from the carrying on of a trade or
business by the pension fund or through an associated enterprise.
5. With reference to paragraph 3 of Article 10 (Dividends) of the
Agreement, paragraph 4 of this Protocol shall apply in the case of
dividends paid by a U.S. Regulated Investment Company (RIC), U.S.
Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), and Vietnamese Real Estate
Investment Fund (VREIF). However, in the case of dividends paid by a
REIT or a VREIF, paragraph 4 of this Protocol shall only apply if one or
more of the conditions in subparagraphs 3(a)(i) through 3(a)(iii) of
Article 10 (Dividends) of the Agreement are met.
43
6. With reference to paragraph 3 of Article 10 (Dividends) of the
Agreement, if the competent authorities of the Contracting States agree
that an entity created pursuant to legislation enacted by Viet Nam after
the date of signature of the Agreement is equivalent to a U.S. Regulated
Investment Company (RIC), paragraph 3 of Article 10 shall apply to
dividends paid by such an entity.
7. With reference to Article 11 (Interest) of the Agreement, paragraph 4 of
Article 11 applies to interest arising in the United States that is
contingent interest of a type that does not qualify as portfolio interest
under United States law.
8. With reference to paragraph 2 of Article 18 (Pensions, Social Security,
Annuities, Alimony, and Child Support) of the Agreement, in the case of
the United States, the phrase “similar legislation” is intended to refer to
tier 1 Railroad Retirements benefits.
9. With reference to paragraph 1 of Article 25 (Non-Discrimination), for
the purposes of United States taxation, United States nationals who are
subject to tax on a worldwide basis are not in the same circumstances as
nationals of Viet Nam who are not residents of the United States.
This Protocol shall enter into force on the date of entry into force of the
Agreement and shall be an integral part thereof.
44
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned, being duly authorized thereto
by their respective Governments, have signed this Protocol.
DONE at Washington D.C in duplicate, in the English language, this 7th day
