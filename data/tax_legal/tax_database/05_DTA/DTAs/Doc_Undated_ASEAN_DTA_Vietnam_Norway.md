permanent establishment in the first-mentioned Contracting State in respect of any activities
which that person undertakes for the enterprise, if such a person:
a. has and habitually exercises in that State an authority to conclude contracts in the

ARTICLE 7
BUSINESS PROFITS
1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State
unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent
establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the
enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to:
a. that permanent establishment;
b. sales in that other State of goods or merchandise of the same or similar kind as those
sold through that permanent establishment; or
c. other business activities carried on in that other State of the same or similar kind as
those effected through that permanent establishment. However, the provisions of letters (b) and
(c) of this paragraph shall not apply if the enterprise proves that such sale or activities are totally
independent with the business carried on through the permanent establishment.
2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State
carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated
therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the
profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in
the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly
independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.
3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as
deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the business of the permanent
establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in
the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. However, no such
deduction shall be allowed in respect of amounts, if any, paid (otherwise than towards
reimbursement of actual expenses) by the permanent establishment to the head office of the
enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of royalties, fees or other similar payments in return
for the use of patents or other rights, or by way of commission, for specific services performed or
for management, or, except in the case of a banking enterprise, by way of interest on moneys lent
to the permanent establishment. Likewise, no account shall be taken, in the determination of the
profits of a permanent establishment, for amounts charged (otherwise than towards
reimbursement of actual expenses), by the permanent establishment to the head office of the
enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of royalties, fees or other similar payments in return
for the use of patents or other rights, or by way of commission for specific services performed or
for management, or, except in the case of banking enterprise by way of interest on moneys lent to
the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices.
4. Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State
relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person in cases where the information
available to the competent authority of that State is inadequate to determine the profits to be
attributed to a permanent establishment, provided that such law shall be applied, so far as the
information available to the competent authority permits, consistently with the principles of this
Article.
5. Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be
attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the
enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that Contracting State from
determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method
of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the
principles contained in this Article.
6. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the
permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is
good and sufficient reason to the contrary.
7. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles
of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of
this Article.
ARTICLE 8
SHIPPING AND
AIR TRANSPORT
1. Profits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of aircraft or
ships in international traffic shall be taxable only in that Contracting State.
2. For the purposes of this Article, profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in
international traffic include:
a. income from the rental on a bareboat basis of ships or aircraft; and
b. profits from the use, maintenance or rental of containers (including trailers and related
equipment for transport of containers) used for transport of goods or merchandise;
where such rental or such use, maintenance or rental, as the case may be, is incidental
to the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic.
3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool,
a joint business or an international operating agency.
4. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall apply to profits derived by the joint
Norwegian, Danish and Swedish air transport consortium Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS),
but only insofar as profits derived by Det Norske Luftfartsselskap A/S (DNL), the Norwegian
partner of the Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), are in proportion to its share in that
organization.
ARTICLE 9
ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES
1. Where
a. an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the
management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or
b. the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control
or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting
State,
and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their
commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between
independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to
one of the enterprises, but, by the reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be
included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.
2. Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State
relating to the determination of the tax liablity of a person, including determination in cases where
the information available to the competent authority of that State is inadequate to determine the
income to be attributed to an enterprise, provided that such law shall be applied, so far as it is
practicable to do so, consistently with the principles of this Article.
ARTICLE 10
DIVIDENDS
1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of
the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.
2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the
company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the
recipient is the beneficial owner of the dividends the tax so charged shall not exceed:
a. 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company
which holds directly at least 70 per cent of the share capital of the company paying the dividends;
b. 10 per cent of the gross amount of dividends if the beneficial owner is a company which
holds directly at least 25 per cent but less than 70 per cent of the share capital of the company
paying the dividends;
c. 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.
This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out
of which the dividends are paid.
3. The term "dividends" as used in this Article means income from shares, mining shares,
founders' shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income
from other corporate rights which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from
shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.
4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the
dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting
State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident through a permanent
establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services
from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is
effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case, the
provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.
5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income
from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid
by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other Contracting
State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected
with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the
company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the
dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in
such other State.
ARTICLE 11
INTEREST
1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting
State may be taxed in that other State.
2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises,

the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.

between the competent authorities of the Contracting States;

debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures.
Penalty charges for late payment shall not be regarded as interest for the purpose of this Article.
5. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the
interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting
State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or
performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein and
the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with (a) such
permanent establishment or fixed base, or with (b) business activities referred to under (c) of
paragraph 1 of Article 7. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be,
shall apply.
6. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State
itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the
person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a
Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the
indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such
permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State
in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.
7. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner
or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the
debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the
payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article
shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments
shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the

and according to the laws of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the royalties
the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of such royalties.
3. The term "royalties" as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a
consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work
including cinematograph films, or films or tapes used for radio or television broadcasting, any
patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for the use of, or the right

royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting
State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or
performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein,
and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with (a)
such permanent establishment or fixed base, or with (b) business activities referred to under (c)
of paragraph 1 of Article 7. In such cases the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may
be, shall apply.

itself, a political subdivision, or a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the
person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a
Contracting State a permanent establishment or fixed base in connection with which the liability to
pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment or
fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent
establishment or fixed base is situated.
6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner
or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the
use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been
agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the
provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess
part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due
regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement.

(alone or with the whole enterprise) or of such fixed base, may be taxed in that other State.
3. Gains derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the alienation of ships,
aircraft or containers (including trailers and related equipment for the transport of container)

METHODS FOR ELIMINATION
OF DOUBLE TAXATION
1. In Vietnam, double taxation shall be eliminated as follows:
Where a resident of Vietnam derives income, profits or gains which under the law of
Norway and in accordance with this Agreement may be taxed in Norway, Vietnam shall allow as a
credit against its tax on the income, profits or gains an amount equal to the tax paid in Norway.
The amount of credit, however, shall not exceed the amount of Vietnamese tax on that income,
profits or gains computed in accordance with the taxation laws and regulations of Vietnam.
2. In Norway, double taxation shall be eliminated as follows:
a. Subject to the provisions of the law of Norway regarding the allowance as a credit
against Norwegian tax of tax payable in a territory outside Norway (which shall not affect the
general principle hereof), where a resident of Norway derives income which, in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement, may be taxed in Vietnam, Norway shall allow as a deduction
from the tax on the income of that resident, an amount equal to the income tax paid in Vietnam.
Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the income tax, as computed
before the deduction is given, which is attributable to the income which may be taxed in Vietnam;
b. Where in accordance with any provisions of this Agreement, income derived by a
resident of Norway is exempt from tax in Norway, Norway may nevertheless, in determining the
tax rate applicable to the remaining income of such resident, take into account the exempted
income;
c. For the purpose of subparagraph 2(a.) of this Article, the income tax paid in Vietnam by
a resident of Norway in respect of business profits earned through a permanent establishment
situated in Vietnam, shall be deemed to include any amount of tax which would have been
payable as Vietnamese tax for any year but for a reduction of tax granted for that year or any part
thereof as a result of the application of the provisions of Vietnamese law designed to extend time
limited tax incentives to promote foreign investment for development purposes. The provisions of
this subparagraph shall, however, not apply to profits derived from manufacturing or financial
activities and also provided that no more than 25 per cent of the profits of such permanent
establishment consist of interest and gains from the alienation of shares or bonds, or consist of
profits derived from third States. The provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply to
Vietnamese profit remittance tax imposed on the remitted profits of a permanent establishment of
a Norwegian enterprise;
d. For the purpose of subparagraph 2(a) of this Article, Vietnamese tax paid in
accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 10 shall, irrespective of the amount of tax actually paid, be
deemed to be 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends received from sources in Vietnam,
insofar as such tax or any part thereof has been reduced as a result of the application of the
provisions of Vietnamese Law designed to promote development. The provisions of this
subparagraph shall, however, not apply to dividends paid out of profits derived from
manufacturing or financial activities and also provided that no more than 25 per cent of the profits
out of which the dividends are paid consist of interest and gains from the alienation of shares or
bonds or profits derived from third States;
e. For the purpose of subparagraph 2(a) of this Article, Vietnamese tax paid in
accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 11 shall, irrespective of the amount of tax actually paid, be
deemed to be 10 percent of the gross amount of interest received from sources in Vietnam,
insofar as such tax or any part thereof has been reduced as a result of the provisions of
Vietnamese Law designed to promote development and provided the loan on which the interest is
paid has been approved by the Government of Vietnam and the interest is received by a
Norwegian financial institution;
f. For the purpose of subparagraph 2(a) of this Article, Vietnamese tax paid in
accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 12 shall, irrespective of the amount of tax actually paid, be
deemed to be 10 per cent of the gross amount of royalties received from sources in Vietnam,
insofar as such tax or any part thereof has been reduced as a result of the application of the
provisions of Vietnamese Law designed to promote development;
g. The provisions of subparagraphs 2(c), 2(d), 2(e) and 2(f) of this Article shall apply for
the first 10 years for which this Agreement is effective. The competent authorities shall consult
each other in order to determine whether this period shall be extended.
ARTICLE 24
NON-DISCRIMINATION
1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to
any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than
the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same
circumstances are or may be subjected.
2. The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State
has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the
taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. This provision
shall not be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other
Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on
account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents.
3. Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 7 of Article 11 or
paragraph 6 of Article 12 of this Agreement apply, interest, royalties, and other disbursements
paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for
the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same
conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State.
4. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not
be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith
which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other
similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.
5. The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 4 of this Article shall not apply to the Vietnamese
profit remittance tax, which in any case shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of
profits remitted, and the Vietnamese taxation in respect of oil exploration or production activities
or in respect of agricultural production activities.
6. Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed as obliging either Contracting State
to grant to individuals not resident in that State any of the personal allowances, reliefs and
reductions for tax purposes which are granted to individuals so resident.
7. The provisions of this Article shall apply only to the taxes which are the subject of this
Agreement.
8. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article, for so long as Vietnam continues to grant
to investors licenses under the Law on Foreign Investment in Vietnam, which specify the taxation
to which the investor shall be subjected, the imposition of such taxation shall not be regarded as
breaching the terms of paragraphs 2 and 4 of this
ARTICLE.
ARTICLE 25
MUTUAL AGREEMENT
PROCEDURE
1. Where a person who is a resident of a Contracting State considers that the actions of
the competent authority of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in
taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, he may, irrespective of the
remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present his case to the competent
authority of the Contracting State of which that person is a resident. The case must be presented
within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance
with the provisions of the Agreement.
2. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified
and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual
agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the
avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with this Agreement. Any agreement reached
shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting
States.

provided for in this Article. In addition, a competent authority may devise appropriate unilateral
procedures, conditions, methods and techniques to facilitate the above-mentioned bilateral
actions and the implementation of the mutual agreement procedure.
ARTICLE 26
EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION
1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information
as is relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Agreement or of the domestic laws of the
Contracting States concerning taxes covered by the Agreement in sofar as the taxation
thereunder is not contrary to the Agreement. Any information received by a Contracting State
shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of
that State. However, if the information is originally regarded as secret in the transmitting State it
shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies)
involved in the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the
determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes which are the subject of the Agreement. Such
persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the
information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. The competent authorities shall,
through consultation, develop appropriate conditions, methods and techniques concerning the
matters in respect of which such exchanges of information shall be made, including, where
appropriate, exchanges of information regarding tax avoidance.
2. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 be construed so as to impose on a
Contracting State the obligation:
a. to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative
practice of that or of the other Contracting State;
b. to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of
the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;
c. to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial
or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary
to public policy (ordre public).
