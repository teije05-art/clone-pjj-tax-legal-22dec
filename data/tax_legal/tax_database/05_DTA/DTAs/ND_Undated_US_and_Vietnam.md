(US) beginning on or after 1 January of the calendar year immediately following the year
of the Treaty’s entry into force. The Treaty is consistent with, although not identical to,
the general approach of the 2006 US Model Income Tax treaty (the 2006 Model Treaty)
and other recently negotiated US income tax treaties and protocols. Amongst others,
this Alert highlights the following key provisions of the Treaty:
• The definition of permanent establishment is broadened to include the “furnishing
of services, including consultancy services … .through employees or other personnel
engaged by the enterprise for such purpose, but only if activities of that nature
continue (for the same or a connected project) … .for a period or periods aggregating
more than six months within any twelve-month period.”1
• The Treaty provides maximum allowable tax rates on certain cross-border payments
of dividends, interests and royalties:
− Dividends are taxed at a maximum rate of 5% if the beneficial owner is (i) a Vietnam
company that owns directly at least 25% of the voting stock a US distributing
company, or (ii) a US company that owns directly at least 25% of the capital of a
Vietnam distributing company. All other dividends are taxed at 15%.
