7. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is
controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries

carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment

conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent
establishment.
3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as
deductions all expenses, including executive and general administrative expenses, which

as they are reasonably allocable to the permanent establishment, whether incurred in the
Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.
5
4. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere
purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.

or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the
other Contracting State,
and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their
commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between
independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have
accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued,
may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.
ARTICLE 10 - DIVIDENDS
1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident

recipient is the beneficial owner of the dividends the tax so charged shall not exceed:

Vietnamese tax.

same meaning as in paragraph 4(a) of Article 11.
5. The term "dividends" as used in this Article means income from shares, mining
shares, founders' shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as
well as income from other corporate rights which is subjected to the same taxation treatment
as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution
is a resident.
6. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the
dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other
Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident through a
permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent
personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the
dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base.
In such case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends

Contracting State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is
effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other
State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's
undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or

does not impose a tax on dividends in addition to the tax chargeable on the profits or income
of a company, dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Singapore to a resident of
Vietnam shall be exempt from any tax in Singapore which may be chargeable on dividends
in addition to the tax chargeable on the profits or income of the company.
ARTICLE 11 - INTEREST
1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting
State may be taxed in that other State.

interest the tax so charged shall not exceed 10% of the gross amount of the interest.

kind, whether or not secured by mortgage, and whether or not carrying a right to participate
in the debtor's profits, and, in particular, income from Government securities and income
from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities,
bonds or debentures. Penalty charges for late payment shall not be regarded as interest for
the purpose of this Article.
6. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the
interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting
State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or
performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein
and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such
permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14,
as the case may be, shall apply.
7. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that state
itself, a political sub-division, a local authority, a statutory body or a resident of that State.
Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a Contracting
State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in
connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such
interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be
deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.
8
8. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial
owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having
regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been
agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the
provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the
excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting
State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement.

royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed:
(a) 5% of the gross amount of the royalties in respect of payments of any kind
received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any patent,
design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for the use of, or the right

for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, or for
information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience.

royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other
Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated
therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base
situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is
effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the
provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.
5. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that
State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority, a statutory body or a resident of that
State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a
Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or fixed base
in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are
borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed
to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.
6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial
owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having
regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which
would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such
relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In

such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of
each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement.

sources in Vietnam shall be exempt from tax, or taxed at a reduced rate, in Vietnam and
under the laws in force in Singapore the said income is subject to tax by reference to the
amount thereof which is remitted to or received in Singapore and not by reference to the full
amount thereof, then the exemption or reduction of tax to be allowed under this Agreement
in Vietnam shall apply only to so much of the income as is remitted to or received in
Singapore.
2. However, this limitation does not apply to income derived by the Government of
Singapore or any person approved by the competent authority of Singapore for the purpose
of this paragraph. The term "Government of Singapore" shall have the same meaning as in

ARTICLE 24 - ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION
1. The laws in force in either Contracting State shall continue to govern the taxation of

made in this Agreement. Where income is subject to tax in both Contracting States, relief
from double taxation shall be given in accordance with the following paragraphs of this
Article.
2.
(a) Where a resident of Vietnam derives income, which in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, may be taxed in Singapore, Vietnam shall allow
as a deduction from the Vietnamese tax on the income of that resident an
amount equal to the tax paid in Singapore. Where such income is a dividend
paid by a company which is a resident of Singapore to a resident of Vietnam
which is a company owning directly or indirectly not less than 10% of the
share capital of the first-mentioned company, the deduction shall take into
account the Singapore tax paid by that company on the portion of its profits
out of which the dividend is paid. The deduction shall not, however, exceed
that part of the Vietnamese tax, as computed before the deduction is given,
which is attributed to that income.
(b) For the purposes of subparagraph (a) above, the term "tax paid in Singapore"
shall be deemed to include the amount of Singapore tax which, under the
laws of Singapore and in accordance with this Agreement, would have been
paid had the Singapore tax not been exempted or reduced in accordance
with:
(i) the provisions of the sections 13(2), 13A, 13B, 13F, 43A and 43C to
43K of the Income Tax Act, 1947 (As Amended) and the provisions of
the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act,
1967 (As Amended), together with the respective connected
regulations, as are effective on the date of signature of this Agreement
or have been modified only in minor aspects after the date of
signature of this Agreement; or
(ii) any other special incentive measure designed to promote economic
development in Singapore which may be introduced hereafter in
modification of, or in addition to, the existing laws, as may be agreed
between the two competent authorities.
13
3.
(a) Where a resident of Singapore derives income from Vietnam or receives such
income in Singapore which, in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, may be taxed in Vietnam, Singapore shall, subject to its laws
regarding the allowance as a credit against Singapore tax of tax paid in any
country other than Singapore, allow the Vietnamese tax paid, whether directly
or by deduction, as a credit against the Singapore tax payable on the income
of that resident. Where such income is a dividend paid by a company which is
a resident of Vietnam to a resident of Singapore which is a company owning
