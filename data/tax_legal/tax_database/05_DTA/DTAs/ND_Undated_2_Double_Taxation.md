1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State
unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a
permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as
aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much
of them as is attributable to:
a. that permanent establishment; or
b. sales in that other State of goods or merchandise of the same or similar kind as those
sold through that permanent establishment; or
c. other business activities carried on in that other State of the same or similar kind as
those effected through that permanent establishment.
The provisions of subparagraphs (b) and (c) shall not apply if the enterprise
shows that such sales or activities could not reasonably have been undertaken by that
permanent establishment.
2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State
carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment
situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent
establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and
separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar
conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a
permanent establishment.
3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as
deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the business of the
permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so
incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or
elsewhere. However, no such deduction shall be allowed in respect of amounts, if any,
paid (otherwise than towards reimbursement of actual expenses) by the permanent
establishment to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of
royalties, fees or other simlar payments in return for the use of patents or other rights,
or by way of commission, for specific services performed or for management, or,
except in the case of a banking enterprise, by way of interest on moneys lent to the
permanent establishment. Likewise, no account shall be taken, in the determination of
the profits of a permanent establishment, for amounts charged (otherwise than towards
reimbursement of actual expenses), by the permanent establishment to the head office
of the enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of royalties, fees or other similar
payments in return for the use of patents or other rights, or by way of commission for
specific services performed or for management, or, except in the case of banking
enterprise by way of interest on moneys lent to the head office of the enterprise or any
of its other offices.
4. Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State
relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person in cases where the
information available to the competent authority of that State is inadequate to
determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment, provided that such
law shall be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority
permits, consistently with the principles of this Article.
5. Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be
attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total
profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that
Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment
as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such
that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article.
6. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere
purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.
7. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the
permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless
there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.
8. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other
Article of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by
the provisions of this Article.
ARTICLE 8
SHIPPING AND AIR TRANSPORT

or ships in international traffic shall be taxable only in that Contracting State.

pool, a joint business or an international operating agency.
4. With respect to profits derived by the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish air transport
consortium, known as the Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), the provisions of

Danish partner of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS).
ARTICLE 9
ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES
1. Where
a. an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the
management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or
b. the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or
capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other
Contracting State,
and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises
in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be
made between independent enterprises, the any profits which would, but for those
conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by the reason of those
conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and
taxed accordingly.
2. Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State
relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, including determinations
in cases where the information available to the competent authority of that State is
inadequate to determine the income to be attributed to an enterprise, provided, that
such law shall be applied, so far as it is practicable to do so, consistently with the
principles of this Article.
3. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and
taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting state has
been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which
would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions
made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made
between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate
adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining
such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and
the competent authorities of the Contracting State shall, if necessary, consult each
other.
ARTICLE 10
DIVIDENDS
1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident
of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.
2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the
company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but
if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the dividends the tax so charged shall not

rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, and income from other corporate
rights which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the
laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.

dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other
Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident through a
permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent
personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of
which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent
establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as
the case may be, shall apply.
5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or
income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on
the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a
resident of that other Contracting State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the
dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed
base situated in that other State, not subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax
on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed

the interest the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the

purpose of this Article.

interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other
Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment
situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a
fixed base situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is
effectively connected with (a) such permanent establishment or fixed base, or with (b)
business activities referred to under (c) of paragraph 1 of Article 7. In such case the
provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.
6. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State

or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in
connection with which the indebtedness in which the interest is paid was incurred, and
such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such
interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or
fixed base is situated.
7. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial
owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest,
having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would
have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such
relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned
amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according

of the royalties the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of
the royalties. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the royalties are paid with
respect to any patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for

fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties
are paid is effectively connected with (a) such permanent establishment or fixed base
or with (b) business activities referred to under (c) of paragraph 1 of Article 7. In such
cases the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.
5. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State
itself, a political subdivision, or a local authority or a resident of that State. Where,
however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting
State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or fixed base in
connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and such
royalties are borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, the such royalties
shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed
base is situated.
6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial
owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties,
having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the
amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in
the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the
last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain

NON-DISCRIMINATION

State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other

residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions
for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it
grants to its own residents.
3. Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 7 of Article 11,
or paragraph 6 of Article 12, apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by

controlled, directly or indirectly by one or more residents of the other Contracting

taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-
mentioned State are or may be subjected.

Vietnamese profit remittance tax, which in any case shall not exceed 10 per cent of the

reliefs and reductions for tax purposes which are granted to individuals so resident.
7. The provisions of this Article shall apply only to the taxes which are the subject of
this Agreement.
8. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article, for so long as Vietnam continues to
grant to investors licenses under the Law on Foreign Investment in Vietnam, which
specify the taxation to which the investor shall be subjected, the imposition of such
taxation shall not be regarded as breaching the terms of paragraphs 2 and 4 of this
Article.
