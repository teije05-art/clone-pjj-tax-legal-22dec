enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent

Article 7. Business profits
1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the
enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment
situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise
may be taxed in the other Contracting State, but only on the profits attributable to that permanent
establishment.
2. Subject to the provisions of Clause 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on
business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there
shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it
might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or
similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the
enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.
3. In the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as
deductions expenses which include the executive and general administrative expenses so
incurred, whether in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated or
elsewhere.
4. Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be attributed
to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the
enterprise to its various parts, nothing in Clause 2 shall preclude such Contracting State from
determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary. The method
of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the
principles contained in this Article.
5. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by
that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.
6. For the purposes of the preceding clauses, the profits to be attributed to the permanent
establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and
sufficient reasons to the contrary.

control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or
b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an
enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,
and in either case, conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their
commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between
independent enterprises, then any profits which would have accrued to one of the enterprises,
but, by the reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that
enterprise and taxed accordingly.
2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and taxes
accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to
tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have been accrued to
the enterprise of the first mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises
had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other
State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those
profits. To determine this adjustment, the other provisions of this Agreement shall be considered
and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall consult each other when necessary.
Article 10. Dividends
1. Dividends arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State
may be taxed in that other Contracting State.
2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company
paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that Contracting State, but, if the
recipient is the beneficial owner of the dividends, the tax so charged shall not exceed:
a) when the company paying dividends is a resident of Vietnam:
(i) 7 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company which
controls directly at least 50 per cent of the capital in the company paying the dividends;
(ii) 10 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company which
controls directly at least 25 per cent of the capital in the company paying the dividends;
(iii) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.

partnerships) which owns at least 10 percent of the capital of the company paying the dividends;
(ii) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.
This Clause shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the
dividends are paid.
3. A resident of Vietnam who has received dividends from a company which is a resident of
France may receive the deduction in case this deduction was actually paid by the company under
this dividend. The total untaxed deduction to be refunded is regarded as dividend under the
application of this Agreement. It shall be taxed in France in conformity with the provisions of
Clause 2.
4. The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares, “jouissance” shares or
“jouissance” rights, mining shares, founders’ shares or other rights, not being debt-claims,
participating in profits, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as
income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a
resident. This term does not include the Iincomes applicable in Article 15.
5. The provisions of Clauses 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends,
being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of
which the company paying the dividends is a resident through a permanent establishment
situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base
situated therein, and the holding by virtue of which the dividends are paid is effectively
connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of
Article 7 or Article 13, as the case may be, shall apply.
6. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the
other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the
company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as
the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent
establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed
profits to a tax on the company’s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the
undestributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.
Article 11. Royalties
1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of a other Contracting State may
be taxed in that other Contracting State.

tax so charged shall not exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the royalty.
3. The term "royalties" as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a
consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific
work, including cinematograph films, films, tapes or disc for radio or television broadcasting,

right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, or for information concerning
industrial or scientific experience.
4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalty,
being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on industrial or commercial activity in the other
Contracting State in which the royalty arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein,
or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein
and the right or property in respect of which the royalty is paid is effectively connected with such
permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 13, as
the case may be, shall apply.
5. Royalty shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a
political sub division, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person
paying the royalty, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting
State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on
which the royalty is paid was incurred, and such royalty is borne by such permanent
establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State
in which the permanent establishment or a fixed base is situated.
6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or
between both of them and some other persons, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the
use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been
agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the
provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess
part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due
regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement.

or another entity which owns, directly or indirectly, the immovable property situated in a State or

this State.
3. Gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a
permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting

Article 22. Elimination of double taxation
1. In the case of Vietnam, double taxation shall be avoided as follows:
Where a resident in Vietnam derives income or property which shall be levied in France in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, Vietnam shall:
a) allow as a credit against the tax imposed on the income of that resident an amount equal to the
income tax paid in France.
b) allow as a credit against the tax imposed on the property of that resident an amount equal to
the proerty tax paid in France.
The amount of credit in both cases, however, shall not exceed the amount of the Vietnamese tax
on that income or property, before permitted tax credit, for such income or property computed in
accordance with the taxation laws and regulations of Vietnam.
2. In the case of France, double taxation shall be avoided as follows:
a) The income generated in Vietnam and taxed or only taxed in Vietnam in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to be taxed according to the tax treatment of
France, if the person entitled to such income is a resident of France and if such income is not
entitled to exemption or reduction of corporate tax in accordance with French law. In this case,
the tax paid in Vietnam is not deducted from such income, but the income beneficiary is entitled
to a tax credit for tax to be paid in France. This tax credit is equal to:
(i) for all income other than the income set forth in point (ii) below, the French tax is
corresponding to such income;
(ii) for the income set forth in Articles 10, 11 and Clauses 1 and 2 of Article 12, Clause 3 of
Article 14, Article 15 and Clause 1 and 2 of Article 16, with the tax paid in Vietnam according to
the provisions in the articles or that amounts; however, that deduction can not exceed the total
number of French tax corresponding to such income.
b) As regulated in Point a) of this Clause, when the tax credit is deducted from the tax payable in
France equals the total taxes payable in Vietnam, tax credit is deemed to be equal to the tax that
should have been paid in Vietnam according to the application of laws of Vietnam and
limitations set forth in this Agreement if the corresponding income not entitled to the tax
exemption or reduction effective from the date of signature of this Agreement such as the
exemption or reduction provided for in the law foreign investment in Vietnam dated 29/12/1987.
The competent authorities of both Contracting States shall adopt a general agreement within a
definite period of time to extend such regulations on tax exemption or reduction that may arise
after the date of signature of this Agreement for the purpose of promoting the economic
development of Vietnam.
c) With respect to the application of point a) to the income set forth in Article 11, when the total
taxes paid in Vietnam under the provisions of these articles - excluding taxes which are
regardded as paid under the provisions at point b - exceed the total taxes payable in France
corresponding to the income stated, then a resident of France receiving such income may lodge a
complaint about his case to the French competent authorities. If the French authorities see that
the result of above reality shall lead to taxation which can not be regarded as taxation of after-tax
income, the authorities may, in defined conditions, may deduct the excessive tax item in the total
taxes paid in Vietnam from the taxes payable in France levied on the other gains from foreign
sources of this resident.
d) A French resident derives a property which must be levied in Vietnam according to the
provisions in Clause 1 or 2 of Article 21 must also be levied in France. The tax payable in France
shall be calculated on the property after deduction of tax credit equal to the total taxes paid in
Vietnam levied on this property. This tax credit must not exceed the corresponding total tax
payable in France levied on this property.
Article 23. Mutual agreement
1. Where a resident of a Contracting State considers that the actions of one or both of the
Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with this Agreement,
he may, notwithstanding the remedies provided by the national laws of those States, present his
case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident. The case must
be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
2. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it
is not itself able to arrive at an appropriate solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with
the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation
not in accordance with the Agreement. Any agreement reached shall be implemented
notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.
3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall jointly endeavour to resolve by
mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the application of the Agreement. They
may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the
Agreement.
4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly
for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding clauses.

PROTOCOL
When signing the Agreement between the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and
the Government of the French Republic to avoid double taxation and prevent tax evasion and
contraband for taxes imposed on income and on the property, the persons who signed have
agreed the following provisions which constitute a part of this Agreement.
1. With respect to Clause 1 of Article 4, automatically, the term “resident of a Contracting State”
includes, when this State is French State, the companies have many persons and all other
organizations have many persons and have place of management in France and their members
must be levied on their income respectively in accordance with the law of France.
2. a) With respect to Article 10 and Article 11, if in an Agreement on avoidance of double
taxation and prevention of tax evasion and contraband with a third State which is a member of
the European Economic Community (CEE), Vietnam shall agree upon a tax rate at source lower
than (including the tax rate of 0%) the tax rates mentioned in this Agreement, such tax rates shall
automatically replace the tax rates mentioned in this Agreement and calculated from the effective
date of that Agreement between Vietnam and the mentioned third State.
b) In the event that one or many Agreements on avoidance of double taxation are signed after
30/07/1992 between Vietnam and one or many States of the European Economic Community
(CEE) imply one or many provisions which are like or the same as the ones specified in Article
24 of sample of tax Agreement of Organization for economic Co-operation and Development
(OCDE), Vietnam shall accept a treatment in the most favorable manner by automatic
application of one or many of such provisions to the citizens, enterprises or residents of France
like the citizens, enterprises or residents of that member State.
3. The remuneration paid for technical services, including the analyses or researches with the
scientific, geological or technical character, the industrial researches including the projects
pertaining to the supervision or consultation services shall not be regarded as the royalty but the
gains, as the case may be, apply according to the provisions of Article 7 or Article 13.
4. a) With respect to loan interest, in the event for the purpose of special relationship between the
payer and the beneficiary or in the event of such relationship between this person or the other
person and a third person, the total loan interest, especially when taking into account the interest
and scale of loan thus this interest must be paid, exceeds the total interest agreed upon between
the payer and the beneficiary in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of Article 20
shall only apply to the agreed amount. In this case, the excessive amount must be taxed in
accordance with the law of each Contracting State while considering the other provisions of this
Agreement.
b) Generally for any income or property, no Article in this Agreement shall prevent a
Contracting State to apply its regulations of law to prevent or punish illegal tax evasion or
contraband to the resident of that State.
5. With respect to Clause 2 of Article 22, automatically, the term “the sum of French taxes
corresponding with such gains” is used to specify:
a) sum of relevant net gains multiplied by the tax rate actually applies to those gains. In this case,
the taxes payables to such gains must be calculated by the rated tax;
b) sum of relevant net gains multiplied by the tax rate is drawn from the rate between the tax
actually paid for the entire taxable net gains according to the French tax law with the sum of such
gains in the event the taxes payable for such gains are calculated by the progressive tariff.
Similarly this interpretation also applies to the term "the sum of French taxes corresponding with
such property"
6. No article in this Agreement prevents France to apply its regulations of law which permit the
French resident companies, based on the requirements of such companies, to determine their
taxable profits under the regime of whole gathering especially including the results of
Vietnamese resident branches or permanent establishments situated in Vietnam. However, this
regulation does not affect the law of Vietnam in identification and taxation of profits of the said
branches and permanent establishments according to its law and any other provision of this
Agreement.
7. It is obvious that the provisions in Article of the Agreement between the Government of the
Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the Government of the French Republic on bilateral
promotion and protection of investments signed on 26/05/1992 shall not apply in the field of
taxation.
