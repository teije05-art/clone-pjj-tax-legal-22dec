Kindly to: The Branch of Bayer Vietnam Company Limited 
The General Tax Department (“GDT”) has received the Official Letter without number reference on 16 March 2015 of the Branch of Bayer Vietnam Company Limited (“Bayer Vietnam”) requesting for guidance on permanent establishment (“PE”), which was transferred and assigned by the Ministry of finance (“MoF”) to resolve the issue. In this regard, GDT has the following opinions:
Regarding the service provided by Bayer Vietnam to Bayer Material Science Limited Company (“Bayer Hong Kong”)
Based on the first amended Investment Certificate (“IC”) No. 47202300017 dated 10 November 2006, one of the main business activities of Bayer Vietnam is business management consulting – Code 7414 (including quality control, marketing consulting, selling and after-sales consulting). Accordingly: 
From the legal perspectives:
The scope for business management consulting activities specifically stipulated under the IC of Bayer Vietnam includes three activities: quality control, marketing consulting, selling and after-sale consulting, which does not include “delivering and notifying of purchase orders or following up on debt payments” activities that Bayer Vietnam has provided to Bayer Hong Kong.
Pursuant to the Joint Circular No. 07/2001/TTLT/BKH-TCTK dated 01 November 2001 the investment code No. 7414 – Business management consulting includes 08 subordinating groups of consulting activities (from 71141 – 711410 to 71149-711490) from management consulting service to other business management services. Among of those, there is no provision on “delivering and notifying of purchase orders or following up on debt payments” activities that Bayer Vietnam has provided to Bayer Hong Kong.
The Decision No. 337/QH-BKH dated 10 April 2007 and Central Product Classification (CPC Ver.1) providing respective guidance on the investment code 70200 and 86503 do not provide guidance on the investment code 7414 as stated under Bayer Vietnam’s IC. 
From the economic perspectives:
In case “delivering and notifying of purchase orders or following up on debt payments” activities is provided to Bayer Hong Kong as a normal legal activities of Bayer Vietnam, from the economic perspective, those activities are considered as a part of the routine business activities of Bayer Hong Kong in Vietnam, and is not considered as a preparatory or auxiliary activity for Bayer Hong Kong.
In light of the above, pursuant to Clause 5, Article 5 of the Double Tax Agreement between Vietnam and  Hong Kong (“Vietnam – Hong Kong DTA”), Bayer Vietnam has established a representative relationship with Bayer Hong Kong to implement a part of Bayer Hong Kong’s business activities in Vietnam and therefore, has constituted a PE of Bayer Hong Kong in Vietnam.
Regarding the fact that Bayer Hong Kong holds the right to control Bayer Vietnam’s accounting books and records
Article III and Annex D of the Sales support and marketing contract between Bayer Vietnam and Bayer Hong Kong promulgates on the Account books and records, and the method to determine Bayer Vietnam’s expenses incurred when performing the contract with Bayer Hong Kong. It is necessary for Bayer Hong Kong to keep control of accounting books and records for the accurate and clear review of the expenses that Bayer Vietnam has borne during its implementation of the contract.  
However, regarding the control of Bayer Vietnam’s accounting books and records to determine whether the expenses that Bayer Vietnam incurred during the implementation of the contract is reasonable or not, Bayer Hong Kong should only check the accounting books and records which are directly related to the expenses that Bayer Vietnam has paid and it is not necessary to check all accounting books and records at Bayer Vietnam’s premises as per Article III of the Contract. Thus, the fact that Bayer Hong Kong holds the right to check accounting books and records at Bayer Vietnam’s premises during the working time with notification in advance indicates that Bayer Hong Kong has fully controlled all of Bayer Vietnam’s accounting books and records system, and Bayer Vietnam therefore has lost its independence within the scope of contract implementation.
Pursuant to Clause 6, Article 5 of Hong Kong – Vietnam DTA, Bayer Vietnam has lost its rights to control the accounting books and records and become dependent on Bayer Hong Kong during contract’s implementation.
Hence, in this case, Bayer Hong Kong is determined as having a PE in Vietnam via Bayer Vietnam.
Accordingly, the GDT requests Bayer Vietnam to strictly follow the guidance of the Official Letter No. 3589/TCT-HTQT dated 26 August 2014 and the Official Letter No. 313/TCT-HTQT dated 27 January 2015 of the GDT.
In case Bayer Vietnam does not agree with the resolution as per this Official Letter and other previous guiding official letters from GDT, Bayer Vietnam may inform Bayer Hong Kong to explain the case to the competent authorities in Hong Kong for mutual agreements as per Article 24 (Mutual Agreement Procedure) of the DTA.
The GDT informs the Branch of Bayer Vietnam Company Limited for acknowledgement and implementation./.
