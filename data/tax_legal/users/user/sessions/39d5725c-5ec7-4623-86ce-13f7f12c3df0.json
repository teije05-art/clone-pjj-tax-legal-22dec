The company seeks to apply a 0% Value-Added Tax (VAT) rate to these exports. According to [Doc_Undated_06_2012_TTBTC_EN.md], the Ministry of Finance guides the implementation of the Law on Value-Added Tax, which includes provisions for taxable objects, non-taxable objects, tax payers, and tax calculation methods.\n\n**Regulatory Understanding**\nAccording to [Doc_Undated_129_2008_TTBTC_EN.md], liable to VAT are goods and services used for production, business, and consumption in Vietnam, including goods and services purchased from overseas organizations and individuals, except for those not liable to VAT specified in Section II, Part A of this Circular. Additionally, [Doc_Undated_219_2013_TTBTC_EN.md] states that VAT payers are organizations and individuals producing or trading in VAT-liable goods and services in Vietnam.\n\n**Analysis**\nTo apply a 0% VAT rate, Vingroup must meet certain conditions. According to [Doc_Undated_06_2012_TTBTC_EN.md], the Law on Value-Added Tax and its guiding decrees provide the framework for VAT application. However, the source documents do not explicitly state the conditions for a 0% VAT rate for software service exports. Source does not address this issue.\n\n**Recommendations**\nBased on the analysis, it is recommended that Vingroup consult with the relevant authorities to determine the specific conditions for applying a 0% VAT rate to software service exports. According to [Doc_Undated_129_2008_TTBTC_EN.md], the Ministry of Finance guides the implementation of the Law on Value-Added Tax, and it is likely that additional guidance or regulations may be available.\n\n**Risks**\nFailure to comply with VAT regulations may result in penalties, fines, or other consequences. According to [Doc_Undated_219_2013_TTBTC_EN.md], the Law on Tax Administration provides the framework for tax administration, including penalties for non-compliance.\n\n**Sources**\n- [Doc_Undated_06_2012_TTBTC_EN.md]\n- [Doc_Undated_129_2008_TTBTC_EN.md]\n- [Doc_Undated_219_2013_TTBTC_EN.md]\n\nNote: The source documents provided do not address the specific conditions for applying a 0% VAT rate to software service exports.
