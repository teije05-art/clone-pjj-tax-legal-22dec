Particularly, our comments are mainly based on the legal documents as outlined in Appendix 1.\nImportant note\nWe have been requested to advise on the Vietnamese tax regulatory implications associated with the above arrangements only.

Should there be any changes in the service structure at a later stage, we can assist in updating the comments under a separate engagement.\nOur comments\nFCT and VAT implications\nOverview of Vietnamese taxation\nForeign Contractor Tax (\u201cFCT\u201d) is a comprehensive tax collection regime that applies to, amongst others, foreign business organizations, with or without permanent establishment (\u201cPE\u201d) in Vietnam, doing business in Vietnam or having Vietnam-sourced income on the basis of a contract, agreement or undertaking with Vietnamese organizations. Broadly, FCT is a collection mechanism for Corporate Income Tax (\u201cCIT\u201d) and Value Add Tax (\u201cVAT\u201d).\nConceptually, FCT will not be applied if the goods are supplied with the place of delivery at the border gates, and without accompanied services provided in Vietnam.\nFor goods delivered within the territories of Vietnam, the applicable tax rates for trading activities will be applied at 1% deemed CIT and 1% dee...",

However, the taxing mechanism was guided/mentioned under the above OLs;\nIn practice, the policy makers are becoming well aware of this kind of business model and may insist to tax by carrying out tax audits at the bonded warehouse management or the logistics companies, on the basis that the bonded warehouse managers are required to notify the Customs Office regarding the transfer of ownership of goods stored at the bonded warehouse for management and supervision under the Customs regulations.2\nThe \u201csubstance over form principle\u201d was enacted under the Law on Tax Administration 2019 which is effective from 01 July 2020, being the principle applied in tax administration to analyze transactions and business activities of taxpayers to determine the corresponding tax obligations.3\nGiven the above, the absence of taxing mechanism would not reduce the level of tax risk since (i) the transaction is taxable in principle and (ii) a number of OLs have confirmed taxing mechanism in practice. Since the responsibilities to withhold, declare and pay taxes rests with income payment organization (i.e.\nClient TW) in practice, it is recommended that a private ruling should be obtained from the local tax authorities to confirm the tax position of the transaction and the mechanism to declare and pay taxes in Vietnam.",

The creditable tax amount, however, shall not exceed the amount of the Vietnamese tax computed in accordance with Vietnamese tax regulations.\nAlternatively, the tax paid in Vietnam may also be allowed to be credited against any Australian tax computed on the same income, subject to the provisions of the laws of Australia where the expatriates are considered as tax residents of Australia\nIt is noted that where tax credit under DTA is applied, it should be applied in one country only, i.e. either Vietnam or Australia, not both.\nIncome from capital gain/dividends\nAccording to Article 10 of the DTA, dividends paid by an Australian resident company to a Vietnamese resident individual can be taxed in both countries but the tax so charged shall not exceed 10% of the gross amount of the dividends in Vietnam and 15% in Australia. Whereas the tax rate for dividend under Vietnamese PIT regulations is only 5%, applying DTA does not offer any tax relief for this kind of income from Vietnam perspective;\nTaxation on capital gain is governed under Article 13of the DTA. In particular, taxation on income from share transfer is provided under paragraphs 4 and 5, whereby the taxing rules under the domestic laws of each country would apply (paragraph 5), with an exception provided under paragraph 4, where the transfer by a resident of a Contracting State (e.g. Vietnam) of the shares in a company, the assets of which consists wholly or principally of real property situated in the other Contracting State (e.g. Australia), the income derived therefrom may be taxed in th...",
