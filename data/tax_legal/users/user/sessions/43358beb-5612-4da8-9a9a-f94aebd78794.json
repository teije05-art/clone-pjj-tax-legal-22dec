Broadly, FCT is a collection mechanism for Corporate Income Tax (“CIT”) and Value Add Tax (“VAT”).\nConceptually, FCT will not be applied if the goods are supplied with the place of delivery at the border gates, and without accompanied services provided in Vietnam.\nFor goods delivered within the territories of Vietnam, the applicable tax rates for trading activities will be applied at 1% deemed CIT and 1% deemed VAT on the value of goods. Technically, for imported goods, which has been subject to VAT at import stage, VAT portion of FCT would be exempt.\nObligations for FCT declaration and payment: Except where the foreign entity is qualified to register and directly file taxes to the V...",

We are pleased to provide hereunder our responses to your queries/ concern and recommendations for your perusal.\nBackground information\nCLIENT was established under Investment Registration Certificate (“IRC”) No. XXXXX398729 dated dd mm yy by Hai Phong Economic Zone Authority as a 100% foreign-invested company owned by “the Parent Co”. The Company is primarily engaged in the production of gloves, including leather gloves, sports gloves and other types of gloves. Under the current IRC, CLIENT is entitled to the Corporate Income Tax (“CIT”) incentives of 2-year CIT exemption and 4-year 50% CIT deduction, starting from the first year of having taxable income.\nIn FY2018-FY2019, the Company was in start-up phase and suffered losses. CLIENT is considering several options to treat the losses in compliance with prevailing Vietnamese tax and transfer pricing regulations. The company has raised several questions as follows:\nQuestion 1: How to treat the loss of FY2018? What are the possible solutions?\nQuestion 2: How to prove that prices are in accordance with arm’s length principle?\nQuestion 3: What are potential customs and tax risks that may arise relating to the year-end adjustment in FY2018? Should an adjustment for FY2018 be made?\nQuestion 4: For FY2019, CLIENT’s parent company – has decided to compensate CLIENT on a full cost basis with a mark-up of 5%. Is this rate reasonable? Would the excessive profit be subject to any taxes in Vietnam?\nQuestion 5: What is the proper method to calculate the transfer pricing adjustments when the Company incurred intra-group interest cost?\nGiven this, CLIENT has sought for KPMG’s professional services in addressing the Company’s concerns relating to these options from tax and transfer pricing perspectives.\nUnder our agreed scope of work, we have thoroughly studied questions raised by CLIENT based on prevailing regulations and provided our comments and recommendations hereunder for your perusal. \nLegal basis\nOur comments and advice presented herein are made based on the information provided by CLIENT and the applicable regulations specified in Appendix I.\nOur comments \nFor your ease of information, we provide hereunder our comments and responses beneath your each and every query.\nQuestion 1 - How to treat the loss of FY2018?

However, given Vietnam is a member to OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”), Vietnam’s prevailing TP legislation (i.e. Decree 132/2020/ND-CP - “Decree 132”) broadly aligns with the OECD Guidelines with certain unique local adaptations.  \nDecree 132 applies to taxpayers paying Corporate Income Tax (“CIT”) that have related party transactions (“RPTs”).  Decree 132 applies to both domestic and cross-border RPTs.  It was issued on 5 November 2020 and took effect from 20 December 2020 and applies for the fiscal year 2020 onwards.    \nRelated party definition\nIn principle a related party is any entity deemed to have control over another entity via common ownership (more than 25% direct or indirect holding). \nThe definition of related parties is also broadened to include other arrangements where an entity or individual is deemed to have control over another entity through capital transfers, loans and other special relationships.  Please refer to Annex 1 for details of the other conditions defining related parties.  \nTP methodologies\nUnder Decree 132, there are five (5) acceptable methods for determining arm’s length pricing, which are analogous to those espoused by the OECD Guidelines:\nComparable uncontrolled price (“CUP”) method\nComparable profit margin methods, including:\nResale price method (“RPM”)\nCost plus method (“CPLM”)\nComparable net profit method (“CPM”)\nProfit split method (“PSM”)\nIn general, the methods endorsed by the OECD Guidelines and Decree 132 are similar.  The most appropriate TP method(s) shall be selected in view of the nature and circumstances of the related party transaction, the nature of the transfer pricing method and the availability of reliable data needed to apply the selected method.\nThe standard arm’s length range\nDecree 132 defines the standard arm’s length range to be from the 35th to 75th percentile value derived from at least five (5) independent comparable companies.  In case the results of the taxpayer fall outside the arm’s length range, the Vietnamese taxpayers are required to determine the most appropriate value within the standard arm’s length range to make a transfer pricing adjustment.  In the event of a transfer pricing adjustment initiated by local tax authorities during a tax or transfer pricing audit, local tax authority has the right to make a TP adjustment to the median value of the range.\nInternal and external comparable data\nInternal comparable data refers to transactions between one of the parties to the related party transaction and an unrelated party.  Decree 132 requires the use of internal data for comparability analysis, where applicable.  \nIn case internal...",

  "synthesized_response": "**KPMG TAX MEMORANDUM**\n\n**TO:** Vingroup\n**FROM:** Senior Tax Advisor, KPMG Vietnam\n**DATE:** 24 May 2024\n**SUBJECT:** Value-Added Tax (\"VAT\") Implications on Exported Software Services\n\n---\n\n### 1. Background\n\nThis memorandum addresses the query from Vingroup (\"the Client\") regarding the conditions that must be satisfied to apply the 0% Value-Added Tax (VAT) rate on software services exported to clients in the United States. Our analysis is strictly based on the source documents provided.\n\n### 2. Regulatory Understanding\n\nOur review of the provided source documents reveals limited information directly addressing the conditions for applying the 0% VAT rate. The regulations cited primarily pertain to the conditions for input VAT credit and refund for exported goods and services, as well as general invoicing principles.\n\n*   **Documentation for Exported Goods and Services:** According to CV_0667_01_04_CV_40667_16062017CTHNThoi_diem.md, which references Thông tư số 219/2013/TT-BTC and Thông tư số 119/2014/TT-BTC, the documentation required for the credit or refund of input VAT for exported goods and services includes a \"Commercial invoice\" (\"Hóa đơn thương mại\").\n*   **Use of Invoices for Export Activities:** For export activities, a company does not use an export invoice but rather a commercial invoice (According to CV_0667_01_04_CV_40667_16062017CTHNThoi_diem.md).\n*   **Revenue Recognition for Exports:** The date for determining export revenue for tax purposes is the date of completion of customs procedures as confirmed on the customs declaration (\"Ngày xác định doanh thu xuât khâu đê tính thuê là ngày xác nhận hoàn tat thủ tục hải quan trên tờ khai hai quan\") (According to CV_0667_01_04_CV_40667_16062017CTHNThoi_diem.md).\n*   **VAT on Services Performed Outside Vietnam:** The provided source documents mention certain services performed outside of Vietnam in the context of Corporate Income Tax for foreign enterprises. According to CV_2015_11_23_CV_4943_23112015TCTHuong_dan.md, which references Nghị định 12/2015/NĐ-CP, income from services performed outside of Vietnam (such as repairs, overseas advertising, and overseas training) is not considered taxable income generated in Vietnam for foreign enterprises. The sources do not state whether this principle applies to VAT on services exported by a Vietnamese entity.\n\nThe provided source documents do not contain any other specific articles or clauses that list the definitive conditions for applying the 0% VAT rate to exported services.\n\n### 3. Analysis\n\nBased on the limited information available in the source documents, our analysis of the requirements for applying 0% VAT to Vingroup's exported software services is as follows.\n\n**3.1. Explicit Conditions Mentioned**\n\nThe provided source documents do not explicitly list the conditions for the *application of the 0% VAT rate*. They do, however, mention documentary requirements in the context of claiming *input VAT credit and refund* for exports, which are often related.\n\n*   **Commercial Invoice:** Vingroup must issue a commercial invoice for its exported software services. This is a specific requirement for export activities mentioned in CV_0667_01_04_CV_40667_16062017CTHNThoi_diem.md.\n\n**3.2. Ambiguous Conditions and Unaddressed Issues**\n\nSeveral critical conditions typically associated with the 0% VAT rate for exported services are not addressed in the provided source documents.\n\n*   **Contract with a Foreign Customer:** The source documents do not address the requirement of having a service contract with the U.S.-based client.\n*   **Payment via Bank Transfer:** The source documents do not address the condition that payment for the exported service must be made via bank transfer from the overseas client to a bank in Vietnam.\n*   **Consumption Outside Vietnam:** The source documents do not address the requirement that the software services must be consumed outside of Vietnam.\n*   **Customs Declaration for Services:** According to CV_0667_01_04_CV_40667_16062017CTHNThoi_diem.md, the date for recognizing export revenue is based on the completion of customs procedures on a customs declaration. However, exported services, such as software development, do not typically undergo physical customs clearance or require a customs declaration. The source documents do not provide any guidance on how this requirement should be interpreted or what alternative documentation would be acceptable for exported services.\n*   **Applicable VAT Rate:** The source documents do not explicitly state that exported services are subject to a 0% VAT rate.\n\nIn summary, the source documents are insufficient to provide a comprehensive list of conditions for applying the 0% VAT rate to exported software services.\n\n### 4. Recommendations\n\nGiven the limitations of the provided source documents, we recommend the following course of action:\n\n1.  **Prepare Commercial Invoices:** Vingroup should ensure that it issues commercial invoices for all exported software services, as this is the only documentary requirement specified in the provided sources for export activities (According to CV_0667_01_04_CV_40667_16062017CTHNThoi_diem.md).\n2.  **Seek Official Clarification:** Due to the significant gaps in the provided information, we strongly advise Vingroup to seek a formal ruling or clarification from the relevant tax authority (e.g., the General Department of Taxation or the local Tax Department). A specific inquiry should be made to confirm the complete set of conditions required to apply the 0% VAT rate to exported software services, including the necessary contracts, payment evidence, and potential alternatives to a customs declaration.\n\n### 5. Risks\n\nProceeding without full clarity on the tax requirements entails significant risks:\n\n*   **Risk of Tax Re-assessment:** Applying the 0% VAT rate without satisfying all regulatory conditions (which are not detailed in the provided sources) could lead to the tax authority re-assessing the transaction at the standard VAT rate. This would result in significant VAT arrears.\n*   **Penalties and Interest:** A tax re-assessment would likely be accompanied by late payment interest and administrative penalties.\n*   **Documentary Risk:** The ambiguity surrounding the customs declaration requirement for services poses a risk. The tax authority could challenge the 0% VAT treatment during a tax audit if Vingroup cannot provide what the authority deems to be sufficient and appropriate supporting documentation.\n\n### 6. Sources\n\nThis memorandum is based exclusively on the information contained within the following documents:\n*   [CV_0667_01_04_CV_40667_16062017CTHNThoi_diem.md]\n*   [CV_2015_11_23_CV_4943_23112015TCTHuong_dan.md]",
