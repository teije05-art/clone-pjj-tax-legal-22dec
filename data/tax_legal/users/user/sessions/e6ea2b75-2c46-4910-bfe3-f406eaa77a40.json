Broadly, FCT is a collection mechanism for Corporate Income Tax (“CIT”) and Value Add Tax (“VAT”).\nConceptually, FCT will not be applied if the goods are supplied with the place of delivery at the border gates, and without accompanied services provided in Vietnam.\nFor goods delivered within the territories of Vietnam, the applicable tax rates for trading activities will be applied at 1% deemed CIT and 1% dee...",

However, the taxing mechanism was guided/mentioned under the above OLs;\nIn practice, the policy makers are becoming well aware of this kind of business model and may insist to tax by carrying out tax audits at the bonded warehouse management or the logistics companies, on the basis that the bonded warehouse managers are required to notify the Customs Office regarding the transfer of ownership of goods stored at the bonded warehouse for management and supervision under the Customs regulations.2\nThe “substance over form principle” was enacted under the Law on Tax Administration 2019 which is effective from 01 July 2020, being the principle applied in tax administration to analyze transactions and business activities of taxpayers to determine the corresponding tax obligations.3\nGiven the above, the absence of taxing mechanism would not reduce the level of tax risk since (i) the transaction is taxable in principle and (ii) a number of OLs have confirmed taxing mechanism in practice. Since the responsibilities to withhold, declare and pay taxes rests with income payment organization (i.e.\nClient TW) in practice, it is recommended that a private ruling should be obtained from the local tax authorities to confirm the tax position of the transaction and the mechanism to declare and pay taxes in Vietnam.",
