Broadly, FCT is a collection mechanism for Corporate Income Tax (\u201cCIT\u201d) and Value Add Tax (\u201cVAT\u201d).\nConceptually, FCT will not be applied if the goods are supplied with the place of delivery at the border gates, and without accompanied services provided in Vietnam.\nFor goods deliver",

This original value of the assigned capital must be supported by and based on accounting books, invoices and vouchers; in addition, it must be certified by investors or participants in the business cooperation contract, or according to audit results provided by an independent audit company if the enterprise is a 100% Foreign Invested Enterprise.\n\nOf note, regarding the underlined part above, it is unclear whether the audited financial statements (\u201cFS\u201d) can also be used if the enterprise is not 100% foreign invested (which is the case of JVCo1 and JVCo2). Nevertheless, in practice, the audited FS is normally used in this case together with the payment evidences of capital contribution, and we have not seen any challenge from local tax authorities on such arrangement.\n\nUpon future divestment of ABC1 and ABC2 from JVCo1 and JVCo2 (which we assume are non-public joint stock companies at that time), where ABC1 and ABC 2 will be subject to 20% CAT in Vietnam on the gain (which is calculated as transfer price minus capital cost), there is a risk that the capital cost may be challenged by the Vietnam tax authorities.\n\nBased on another private ruling which was not made public issued by Ho Chi Minh City Tax Department dated 29 January 2021, Investor 1 (Singapore) invested in Investee (Vietnam) with premium. The premium was shared to Investor 2 (BVI), and Investor 2 duly paid tax in Vietnam. Subsequently, Investor 2 contributed such money back into capital contribution in the Investee. The ruling stated that the capital cost when Investor 2 disposes its investment would include such premium value.",
